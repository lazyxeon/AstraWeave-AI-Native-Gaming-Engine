# AstraWeave: One-Page Overview

## **🎯 What It Is**
**The world's first AI-native game engine** where artificial intelligence is built into the core architecture, not retrofitted as an afterthought. AI agents are first-class citizens capable of genuine learning, adaptation, and emergent behavior.

## **⚡ The Big Problem**
Traditional game AI is fundamentally broken: predictable scripted behaviors, cheating that breaks game rules, no learning across sessions, and disconnected from game systems. The $2.8B game engine market lacks true AI innovation.

## **💡 Our Solution**
**Validation-First Architecture**: AI can only act through the same validated tools as human players. No cheating possible. Result: Fair, emergent, genuinely intelligent gameplay.

```
Traditional: Game Logic → AI System → Scripted Behaviors
AstraWeave:  AI Agents ← Tool Validation ← Engine Authority
```

## **🏆 Why We Win**

| **Advantage** | **Impact** |
