# Phase 5: Quick Start Guide

**Date**: January 13, 2025  
**Status**: Ready to Execute  
**Full Plan**: See `PHASE_5_CODEBASE_WIDE_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`

---

## TL;DR: What You Need to Know

After completing Phase 4 (astraweave-ai: 88% coverage), we analyzed **ALL workspace crates** and found:

- ✅ **16 working crates** (tests compile and run)
- ⚠️ **5 broken crates** (need fixing first)
- 📊 **Average coverage: 16.8%** (excluding astraweave-ai)
- 🎯 **Target: 65% average** after Phase 5
- ⏱️ **Timeline: 15-17 weeks** (91 hours total)

---

## Priority 1: Start Here (Week 1)

### 🔥 Most Critical: astraweave-security (3.34% coverage)

**Why Critical**: Security gaps are **HIGHEST RISK** for production deployment.

**Quick Win** (3 hours):
```bash
# Create test file
cd astraweave-security
mkdir -p tests
touch tests/signature_tests.rs

# Add 15 signature validation tests (see full plan section 3.5)
# Run tests
cargo test -p astraweave-security

# Check coverage improvement
cargo tarpaulin -p astraweave-security --lib
```

**Expected Result**: 3.34% → ~25% coverage after 15 tests

---

### 🚨 Second Priority: astraweave-nav (5.26% coverage - MISLEADING!)

**Why Critical**: Current 26 tests **ONLY cover lib.rs** (re-exports). **Core navigation algorithms have 0% coverage!**

**Quick Win** (2 hours):
```bash
# Create navmesh tests
cd astraweave-nav/src
touch navmesh_tests.rs

# Add 10 basic navmesh tests (see full plan section 3.3)
cargo test -p astraweave-nav
cargo tarpaulin -p astraweave-nav --lib
```

**Expected Result**: 5.26% → ~20% coverage after 10 tests
