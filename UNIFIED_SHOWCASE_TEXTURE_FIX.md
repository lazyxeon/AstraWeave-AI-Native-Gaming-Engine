# Unified Showcase Texture Rendering Fix

## Problem Statement
The `unified_showcase` example was rendering as a "gray void with cubes" instead of displaying full 3D visual textures, despite having a comprehensive texture system already implemented.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was **not** missing textures or broken rendering, but rather a missing initialization step. The texture pack system was fully functional but only triggered by keyboard input (keys 1 and 2), and was never initialized at startup.

### What Was Already Working
- ✅ Comprehensive texture assets: grass.png, dirt.png, stone.png with normal maps
- ✅ Advanced shader with albedo + normal mapping support  
- ✅ Texture pack system with grassland.toml and desert.toml configurations
- ✅ Runtime texture switching functionality (keys 1 and 2)
- ✅ Proper wgpu texture binding and rendering pipeline

### What Was Missing
- ❌ Automatic texture pack initialization at startup
- ❌ User guidance about texture switching controls

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes
Modified `examples/unified_showcase/src/main.rs` in the `run()` function:

```rust
// Added after renderer setup:
// Load the initial grassland texture pack
if let Err(e) = reload_texture_pack(&mut render, "grassland") {
    println!("Warning: Failed to load initial grassland texture pack: {}", e);
    println!("Continuing with default textures...");
    println!("Note: You can still switch texture packs using keys 1 (grassland) and 2 (desert)");
} else {
    println!("Successfully loaded initial grassland texture pack");
    println!("Controls: WASD+mouse=camera, P=pause physics, T=teleport sphere, E=apply impulse");
    println!("Texture packs: Press 1 for grassland, 2 for desert");
}
```

### Technical Details
- The `reload_texture_pack()` function was already fully implemented
- It loads TOML configuration from `assets_src/environments/`
- Converts `.ktx2` references to `.png` files automatically
- Creates proper wgpu bind groups with albedo + normal textures
- Updates render state with new textures

## Testing Results

### Texture Loading Verification
```
✓ grass.png (8847 bytes) - Grassland albedo texture
✓ grass_n.png (11737 bytes) - Grassland normal map  
✓ dirt.png (9790 bytes) - Desert albedo texture
✓ dirt_n.png (11323 bytes) - Desert normal map
✓ stone.png (841762 bytes) - Structure albedo texture
✓ stone_n.png (1036188 bytes) - Structure normal map
```

### Runtime Verification
```
Successfully loaded initial grassland texture pack
Controls: WASD+mouse=camera, P=pause physics, T=teleport sphere, E=apply impulse
Texture packs: Press 1 for grassland, 2 for desert
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- Demo started with basic colored cubes on gray background
- Users didn't know about texture switching controls
- Appeared broken despite working texture system

### After Fix  
- Demo starts with full grassland environment and textures
- Clear control instructions displayed on startup
- Easy texture pack switching with keys 1 and 2
- Full 3D visual fidelity with normal mapping and lighting

## Validation
- ✅ Textures load without errors at startup
- ✅ Grassland environment displays immediately  
- ✅ Desert texture switching works (key 2)
- ✅ All shader features functional (normal mapping, lighting)
- ✅ Environment objects generate correctly
- ✅ Physics and interaction systems work

## Impact
This minimal 8-line change transforms the unified_showcase from appearing broken to demonstrating the full capabilities of the AstraWeave texture and rendering systems, providing users with an immediate visual demonstration of the engine's graphics capabilities.
