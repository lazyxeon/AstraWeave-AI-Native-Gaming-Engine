# AstraWeave vs. Unreal Engine 5 - Capability Parity Matrix

This document provides a comprehensive gap analysis of the AstraWeave engine against Unreal Engine 5, outlining the path to feature parity and identifying opportunities for AI-native differentiation.

## 1. Rendering & Scene

| Capability | UE5 Feature | AstraWeave Status | Technical Notes & Code Links | Work Needed | Complexity | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria | Owner (TBD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Global Illumination** | **Lumen** | ❌ | The engine currently uses a simple forward renderer with basic lighting. No GI solution is implemented. See `astraweave-render/src/lighting.rs`. | Implement a real-time GI solution. Start with a probe-based system (DDGI) and evaluate SDF-based or RT-based approaches. | L | `astraweave-render`, `wgpu` RT support | A Cornell Box scene demonstrates convincing multi-bounce indirect lighting. Dynamic lights update GI correctly. | |
| **Virtualized Geometry** | **Nanite** | ❌ | Meshes are loaded and rendered directly. No meshlet-based rendering, virtualized geometry, or HLOD system exists. See `astraweave-render/src/mesh.rs`. | Design and implement a meshlet-based rendering pipeline. This includes a pre-processing step to generate meshlets, a visibility buffer, and a material-aware rasterization pass. | L | `astraweave-render`, `astraweave-asset` | A scene with millions of polygons renders at interactive framerates. Mesh complexity is decoupled from performance. | |
| **Temporal Upscaling** | **TSR / DLSS / FSR** | ❌ | The renderer outputs to a swapchain directly. No temporal anti-aliasing or upscaling is implemented. | Integrate a temporal anti-aliasing solution (TAA) first. Then, add hooks for vendor-specific upscalers like DLSS and FSR 2+. | M | `astraweave-render` | Jittered rendering with motion vectors produces a stable, anti-aliased image. Upscaling from a lower resolution produces a high-quality result. | |
| **Advanced Shading** | **Material System** | ⚠️ | A basic PBR material system exists (`astraweave-render/src/material.rs`). It supports albedo, normal, and MRA textures. It lacks support for clearcoat, anisotropy, subsurface scattering, and other advanced shading models. | Extend the material system and shader library to support a wider range of PBR shading models. Implement a more flexible material definition format. | M | `astraweave-render`, `astraweave-asset` | A material showcase scene demonstrates all supported shading models correctly. | |
| **Scene Composition** | **Sequencer** | ❌ | No timeline-based animation or scene composition tool exists. Cinematics are currently handled via hardcoded scripts. | Create a `Sequencer`-like tool. This involves a data model for tracks, sections, and keyframes, an editor UI, and a runtime evaluation engine. | L | `astraweave-cinematics`, `aw_editor` | A short cinematic with camera cuts, animated characters, and VFX can be created and played back in-engine. | |
| **World Building** | **World Partition** | ❌ | The engine loads entire scenes at once. No support for level streaming, world partitioning, or data layers. | Implement a grid-based world partitioning system. Assets and entities are associated with grid cells, which are streamed in and out based on camera position. | L | `astraweave-scene`, `astraweave-asset` | A large open world can be explored seamlessly without loading screens. Memory usage remains bounded. | |

## 2. Physics & Simulation

| Capability | UE5 Feature | AstraWeave Status | Technical Notes & Code Links | Work Needed | Complexity | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria | Owner (TBD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rigid Body Dynamics** | **Chaos Physics** | ✅ | The engine uses `rapier3d` for rigid body simulation, which is a capable and modern physics engine. See `astraweave-physics/src/lib.rs`. | The foundation is solid. Work is needed to expose more advanced features of Rapier, like more joint types and solver settings. | S | `astraweave-physics` | A physics stress test scene with many interacting objects runs at a stable framerate. | |
| **Character Controller** | **CharacterMovementComponent** | ⚠️ | A custom character controller is implemented in `astraweave-physics/src/lib.rs`. It handles basic movement, but lacks features like network prediction, fluid movement on complex terrain, and integration with an ability system. | Enhance the character controller to support networked prediction, a wider range of movement states (swimming, flying), and better interaction with dynamic objects. | M | `astraweave-physics`, `astraweave-net` | The character can smoothly navigate a complex environment with slopes, stairs, and dynamic obstacles. Movement feels responsive in a networked game. | |
| **Cloth & Soft Body** | **Chaos Cloth** | ❌ | No cloth or soft body simulation is implemented. `rapier3d` has some support for soft bodies, but it's not integrated. | Integrate `rapier3d`'s soft-body simulation. Implement a cloth authoring pipeline for skinning cloth to characters. | L | `astraweave-physics`, `astraweave-asset` | A character with a flowing cape runs and jumps correctly, with the cloth colliding with the character's body and the world. | |
| **Destruction** | **Chaos Destruction** | ❌ | Stub functions for destructibles exist (`add_destructible_box`), but there is no implementation for fracturing meshes or handling geometry collections. | Implement a system for fracturing meshes into destructible chunks (e.g., using Voronoi diagrams). Create a `GeometryCollection`-like component that manages the fractured state. | L | `astraweave-physics`, `astraweave-asset` | A wall can be fractured and destroyed by a projectile, with the resulting debris interacting realistically with the physics world. | |
| **Vehicles** | **Chaos Vehicles** | ❌ | No vehicle simulation is implemented. | Implement a vehicle simulation model using `rapier3d`'s joint and suspension features. Create a component for authoring vehicle properties (e.g., engine, wheels, suspension). | M | `astraweave-physics` | A simple car can be driven around a test track, with realistic suspension and tire physics. | |
