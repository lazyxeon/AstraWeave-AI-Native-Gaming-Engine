### üå≤ Forest Biome Features
- **95+ Ancient Trees**: Heights from 2.2m to 5.2m with species variety (oak, pine, cedar, world trees)
- **60+ Undergrowth Elements**: Ferns, bushes, and forest floor vegetation
- **8 Woodland Structures**: Tree houses, wizard towers, ranger cabins, woodland shrines
- **Geological Features**: Stone circles, moss-covered boulders, forest streams
- **10 Forest Characters**: Rangers, druids, woodland folk with tree-navigation patrol routes

### üéÆ Enhanced User Experience
- **Three-Biome Switching**: Keys 1 (grassland), 2 (desert), 3 (forest)
- **Seamless Transitions**: Smooth biome boundaries with realistic noise patterns
- **Immersive Lighting**: Biome-specific atmospheric effects and lighting colors
