# AstraWeave: One-Page Overview

## **🎯 What It Is**
**The world's first AI-native game engine** where artificial intelligence is built into the core architecture, not retrofitted as an afterthought. AI agents are first-class citizens capable of genuine learning, adaptation, and emergent behavior.

## **⚡ The Big Problem**
Traditional game AI is fundamentally broken: predictable scripted behaviors, cheating that breaks game rules, no learning across sessions, and disconnected from game systems. The $2.8B game engine market lacks true AI innovation.

## **💡 Our Solution**
**Validation-First Architecture**: AI can only act through the same validated tools as human players. No cheating possible. Result: Fair, emergent, genuinely intelligent gameplay.

```
Traditional: Game Logic → AI System → Scripted Behaviors
AstraWeave:  AI Agents ← Tool Validation ← Engine Authority
```

## **🏆 Why We Win**

| **Advantage** | **Impact** |
|---------------|------------|
| **First-Mover** | Only production-ready AI-native engine |
| **Technical Moat** | Deterministic architecture with high replication barriers |
| **Proven Tech** | 23+ working demos, reference game implementation |
| **Developer-Friendly** | Rust-based, modular, open-source core |

## **🎮 What This Enables**

**🤖 Persistent AI Companions**: Learn player tactics, adapt across sessions, verifiable growth  
**👑 Adaptive Boss Encounters**: Multi-phase directors with tactical evolution  
**🌍 Emergent Gameplay**: Complex behaviors from simple tool combinations  
**🎭 Living Worlds**: Games that genuinely learn and evolve with players  


## **📊 Proof Points (2025)**

✅ **Production-Ready Core**: All core engine systems build and pass CI (8–15s build time)
✅ **SDK ABI & C Harness**: Stable C ABI, header auto-generated, validated by C/CMake harness in CI (Linux/Windows)
✅ **Semantic Versioning Gate**: CI enforces SDK version compatibility between Rust and C consumers
✅ **Cinematics Timeline & Sequencer**: Timeline, camera, audio, FX tracks; timeline load/save in UI; smoke-tested in CI
✅ **UI Integration**: Cinematics, timeline, and accessibility panels in egui-based UI; timeline load/save and playback
✅ **AI Planning Demo**: `hello_companion` shows intelligent, validated AI planning (expected LOS panic)
✅ **Multiplayer Validation**: Server-authoritative AI synchronization (core net/IPC crates build and pass tests)
✅ **Cross-Platform Support**: Linux, macOS, Windows (CI-verified)
✅ **Performance Target Met**: 60Hz deterministic simulation, ECS, and physics

## **💰 Business Model**

**Revenue Streams**: Engine licensing (indie to enterprise) • AI model partnerships • Professional services • Platform ecosystem

**Go-to-Market**: Open-source adoption → Commercial licensing → Enterprise partnerships → Hardware platform
