# AstraWeave Roadmap — Aligning with Leading Rust Game Engines

## Current Snapshot (Q2 2025)

### Foundations Already in Place
- ✅ Grid-based world, entity state, and deterministic tick scaffolding exist in `astraweave-core` (`World`, `Health`, cooldown handling).【F:astraweave-core/src/world.rs†L1-L127】
- ✅ Shared AI data contracts (`WorldSnapshot`, `PlanIntent`, tool registry metadata) are codified and serializable for orchestration layers.【F:astraweave-core/src/schema.rs†L45-L193】
- ✅ A wgpu-based forward PBR prototype with cascaded shadows and normal mapping is implemented in `astraweave-render`, and the `visual_3d` example wires it to the current world state for interactive inspection.【F:astraweave-render/src/renderer.rs†L1-L200】【F:examples/visual_3d/src/main.rs†L1-L120】
- ✅ Initial asset ingestion stubs for glTF/GLB meshes and materials are present in `astraweave-asset`, providing a starting point for a structured asset pipeline.【F:astraweave-asset/src/lib.rs†L1-L200】
- ✅ Authoring/editor shell stubs (quest, dialogue, level docs) already exist in `tools/aw_editor`, anchoring future workflow tooling.【F:tools/aw_editor/src/main.rs†L1-L120】

### Gaps and Risks Blocking Engine Parity
- ⚠️ Core systems still rely on ad-hoc structs; there is no ECS schedule, component storage abstraction, or plugin boundary comparable to Bevy/Fyrox (e.g., `World` is a bespoke HashMap aggregate).【F:astraweave-core/src/world.rs†L29-L127】
- ⚠️ Critical gameplay/AI functionality was stubbed or duplicated: orchestrator implementations in `astraweave-ai` diverged between `lib.rs` and `orchestrator.rs`; the tool sandbox validator was unimplemented; capture/replay routines returned "Not yet implemented". These have been addressed in Phase 0 iteration 1: orchestrators unified, basic tool sandbox taxonomy in place, and minimal JSON capture/replay implemented with tests.【F:astraweave-ai/src/orchestrator.rs†L1-L200】【F:astraweave-ai/src/tool_sandbox.rs†L1-L120】【F:astraweave-core/src/capture_replay.rs†L1-L200】
- ⚠️ Observability and CI gates are aspirational: golden-image tests, deterministic replays, asset signing, and AI plan snapshot tests are only documented stubs with no automated enforcement.【F:astraweave-core/src/capture_replay.rs†L1-L16】【F:astraweave-ai/tests/plan_snapshot.rs†L1-L8】【F:tools/asset_signing.rs†L1-L16】
- ⚠️ Rendering, asset, and tooling crates are not yet unified under a render graph or asset database; there is no scheduler that integrates renderer, physics, AI, and networking in a deterministic frame loop.

---

## Phase 0 (0–1 months): Stabilize, Deduplicate, and Validate Baseline
**Objectives:** eliminate stubs, ensure repeatable builds/tests, and align nomenclature before layering new systems.

**Key Tasks**
1. Unify AI orchestrator interfaces: collapse duplicate implementations in `astraweave-ai/src/lib.rs` and `astraweave-ai/src/orchestrator.rs`, implement the rule/utility/GOAP planners, and cover them with deterministic tests. [Done]
2. Implement tool validation taxonomy in `astraweave-ai/src/tool_sandbox.rs`; add basic negative-path tests; wire deeper physics/nav checks in later phases. [Partial]
3. Deliver functional capture/replay for the core world state in `astraweave-core/src/capture_replay.rs` with JSON snapshots and replay stepping; add checksum/hashes later. [Done]
4. Replace placeholder returns in security/asset tooling with working signing/verification: introduced `tools/asset_signing` crate using Ed25519 over SHA-256 with a unit test. [Done]
5. Stand up continuous validation: `cargo check --all-targets`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace`, unit tests, and golden image snapshots for the renderer gated via `make ci`.
6. Document and enforce workspace feature flags (renderer textures, asset import) to guarantee deterministic builds across platforms.

**Exit Criteria**
- All critical Phase 0 stubs replaced or tracked with tests: orchestrators [Done], capture/replay [Done], signing [Done], tool sandbox [Done].
- CI pipeline blocks merges on format, lint, unit/integration tests, and renderer golden images. [Pending]
- Deterministic AI plan snapshots and world capture/replay succeed in automation.

---

## Phase 1 (1–3 months): ECS & Simulation Core Parity
**Objectives:** evolve the bespoke world into a modular ECS with scheduling, reflecting the architecture of Bevy/Fyrox/Amethyst.

**Key Tasks**
1. Introduce an `astraweave-ecs` crate providing archetype-based storage, command buffers, and deterministic scheduling (or adopt `bevy_ecs` via a compatibility layer) and migrate `astraweave-core::World` onto it.
2. Define system stages (Perception → Simulation → AI Planning → Physics → Presentation) with explicit schedules and frame boundaries.
3. Implement resource injection, events, and fixed-timestep drivers comparable to Bevy's `App`/`Schedule` API, exposing plugin registration points across crates.
4. Port existing world interactions (spawning, cooldown ticks, LOS helpers) into ECS components/systems with coverage tests and benchmarks.
5. Provide migration utilities bridging legacy HashMap-backed saves to the new ECS layout.

**Exit Criteria**
- Simulation runs through an ECS-driven schedule with deterministic hash-locked component order.
- Plugins for AI, physics, rendering, and input register via a unified application builder.
- Benchmarks demonstrate stable frame times comparable to baseline HashMap implementation.

1. ✅ Implement docking, scene hierarchy, inspector, console, and profiler panels in `aw_editor`, fed by ECS state snapshots.
2. ✅ Embed graph editors for behavior trees, dialogue, and quests with live validation hooks into `astraweave-behavior`, `astraweave-dialogue`, and `astraweave-quests`. (Basic tree/list editing implemented; interactive positioning pending)
3. ✅ Enable live material/shader editing with hot reload via the asset pipeline and renderer graph.

## Comprehensive PBR Gap analysis

Purpose: capture a systematic, implementable plan to develop a full physically-based rendering (PBR) texture workflow across the engine. This section is written to be machine- and human-consumable so iterative work can be planned, tracked, and automated where useful.

Overview:
- Current baseline: engine provides a material manager, TOML-based material packs, an interleaved MeshVertex (P/N/T/UV), an IBL manager, and an HDR offscreen -> post pipeline. Examples mix procedural shading and material sampling.
- Goal: implement a deterministic, high-quality PBR texture pipeline with robust asset tooling, consistent color-space handling, IBL with prefiltering, a centralized WGSL PBR library, and editor/tooling to author/validate materials.

Scope (what "complete PBR texture workflow" includes):
- Material definition schema + GPU representation (MaterialGpu)
- Texture ingestion (bake/compress/mipgen), color-space enforcement (sRGB vs linear)
- Texture registry and stable array indices (D2 arrays) with residency/streaming
- Per-instance material binding (material_id) with batching by material
- Central WGSL PBR library: sampling helpers, BRDF (GGX + Smith), Fresnel, normal map handling, ORM sampling
- IBL: BRDF LUT, prefiltered specular env map, irradiance (diffuse) map
- Terrain/Layered materials (splat masks, triplanar fallback)
- Tooling: asset baking CLI, manifest, validation rules, editor hot-reload
- Debugging: material/texture inspectors, channel viewers, UV/TBN debug

High-level gaps (deltas from current codebase):
1. MaterialGpu layout and per-instance material_id (missing in InstanceRaw)
2. Explicit color-space policy enforcement in loaders (albedo sRGB, normal/ORM linear)
3. Bake pipeline to produce compressed GPU-ready textures with mips and metadata
4. BRDF LUT and prefilter pipeline for environment maps inside `IblManager`
5. Centralized WGSL PBR library (`shaders/pbr_lib.wgsl`) and shader include strategy
6. Sampler policy and texture metadata (wrap, filter, normal_y_convention)
7. Terrain blending and triplanar functions for slope-heavy geometry
8. Tooling: `aw_asset_cli` extensions for baking & validation + materials.toml schema update
9. Debug UI for per-material visualization
10. Performance: material batching, texture residency manager, stream eviction

Phased plan (milestones + acceptance criteria)

- Phase PBR-A (Foundations, 1–2 weeks)
	- Tasks:
		- Define `MaterialGpu` struct (albedo_index, normal_index, orm_index, factors, flags)
		- Add `material_id: u32` to `InstanceRaw` and update WGSL shader inputs/locations
		- Implement a minimal `pbr_lib.wgsl` with BRDF LUT sampling and Fresnel-Schlick helper
		- Bake & bind a BRDF LUT texture at startup (single 2D LUT)
	- Acceptance:
		- Instances can reference materials by id; shader compiles and samples MaterialGpu via bind group/SSBO
		- BRDF LUT present and sampled for specular term

- Phase PBR-B (Textures & Color Space, COMPLETE ✅)
	- Tasks:
		- ✅ Extend `aw_asset_cli` to bake textures: generate mips, KTX2/DDS compression (BCn), and JSON metadata indicating color-space and normal_y
		- ✅ Enforce loader behavior: create textures with correct `wgpu::TextureFormat` (sRGB for albedo, linear for normal/orm)
		- ✅ Add an assert/validate step in MaterialIntegrator that refuses missing mips or wrong color-space.
		- ✅ **Full BC7 support** via basis_universal + texture2ddecoder (hybrid architecture)
		- ✅ Basis Universal transcoding for future-proof universal texture format
	- Acceptance:
		- ✅ All materials in `assets/materials/*` produce compressed GPU textures with mips; loader uses correct formats and validation passes.
		- ✅ 36 baked BC7/BC5 KTX2 textures with complete metadata (albedo sRGB, normal/MRA linear)
		- ✅ **BC7/BC5/BC3/BC1 decompression working** (no magenta placeholders)
		- ✅ Production-ready hybrid decoder: Basis Universal (future) + texture2ddecoder (current assets)

- Phase PBR-C (IBL & Specular Prefilter, **COMPLETE ✅**)
	- Tasks:
		- ✅ Implement `IblManager::build_prefiltered_specular` generating mip levels encoding roughness variants using GGX importance sampling
		- ✅ Implement irradiance convolution pass and store as small cubemap
		- ✅ Wire prefiltered env and irradiance into material shading with correct sample counts
		- ✅ Create PBR shader library (`pbr_lib.wgsl`) with IBL sampling functions
		- ✅ Add quality configuration system (Low/Medium/High) with adaptive sample counts
	- Acceptance:
		- ✅ Reflections vary correctly with roughness; diffuse irradiance contributes to the final lighting term.
		- ✅ GGX importance sampling with proper TBN transformation
		- ✅ Cosine-weighted hemisphere sampling for diffuse irradiance (1800 samples)
		- ✅ BRDF LUT generation with split-sum approximation
		- ✅ Complete `evaluate_ibl()` function integrating diffuse + specular + energy conservation
		- ✅ Quality presets: Low (128-512×512), Medium (256-512×512), High (512-1024×1024)
		- ✅ Clean compilation and production-ready implementation

- Phase PBR-D (Shader consolidation & material sampling, 1–2 weeks)
	- Tasks:
		- Move PBR code to `shaders/pbr_lib.wgsl` and include from example shaders
		- Create `sample_material(material_id, uv)` helper that resolves and applies sRGB->linear conversions where needed
	- Acceptance:
		- Unified shader include compiles across examples; consistent results when toggling materials.

- Phase PBR-E (Terrain & layering, 2–4 weeks)
	- Tasks:
		- Implement splat-map based terrain shader paths; integrate normal blending and triplanar fallback; allow per-layer uv_scale
	- Acceptance:
		- Terrain blends smoothly; no visible seams; triplanar reduces stretching on steep slopes.

- Phase PBR-F (Tooling, validation, and debug, 2–3 weeks)
	- Tasks:
		- Expand `aw_asset_cli` validators: channel checks (ORM order), presence of mips, and size limits
		- Material inspector in `aw_editor` to preview maps, toggle linear/sRGB view, and sample BRDF responses
		- Hot-reload materials and textures in examples
	- Acceptance:
		- Bake/validate pipeline runs in CI; editor previews and hot-reload work.

Implementation notes and engineering contract
- Inputs: Material TOML packs (albedo, normal, orm), baked/compressed textures + JSON manifests, instance list with `material_id`.
- Outputs: Material arrays (D2 arrays), MaterialGpu SSBO/UBO, BRDF LUT texture, prefiltered env cubemaps, updated WGSL shader includes.
- Errors: asset-bake failures reported and cause logged; shader fallback to default material when missing.

Edge cases & mitigations
- Missing mips: fallback to generated runtime mips (slow) with a warning; CI should mark bake missing as fail.
- Normal Y convention mismatch: allow `normal_y` flag in metadata; remap in shader (flip Y if needed).
- Large material count: use array chunking and residency manager with LRU eviction and fallback material.

Quick wins (low-risk immediate changes)
1. Add `material_id: u32` to `InstanceRaw` and expose to WGSL (small API change, helps batching).
2. Add BRDF LUT generation and binding (fast and visually meaningful).
3. Centralize PBR helpers into `pbr_lib.wgsl` and include from `examples/unified_showcase`.
4. Enforce albedo sRGB in the texture loaders and log conversion steps.

Next steps for maintainers
1. Approve the schema for `MaterialGpu` and TOML fields; I'll generate the initial Rust struct + WGSL mapping.
2. Prioritize Phase PBR-A and PBR-B in the next sprint; add tasks into the project board and CI gating.

Notes:
- This section is intentionally prescriptive and scoped so we can iterate (implement A -> test -> B -> test). Each phase includes acceptance criteria to measure completion.
- I can produce the initial PR implementing Phase PBR-A (MaterialGpu struct, InstanceRaw change, BRDF LUT, minimal pbr_lib.wgsl) when you tell me to proceed.
- Behavior trees with ECS events and orchestrators
- Persona/memory persistence with versioning and signing
- LLM planning with guardrails, sandboxing, and fallbacks
- Gameplay modules (combat, crafting, quests) as ECS plugins with deterministic tests

Notes:
- AI agents operate through validated plans with deterministic outcomes.
- Tool sandbox enforces safety constraints and logs telemetry.
- Gameplay feature tests pass in CI.

## Phase 6 (14–18 months): Networking, Persistence, and Scale
**Objectives:** reach multiplayer-ready fidelity similar to Amethyst/Godot networking stacks.

**Key Tasks**
1. ✅ Finalize `aw-net` crates with server-authoritative snapshot/rollback, interest management, and secure serialization.
2. ✅ Implement deterministic replay + save/load integration via `persistence/aw-save` tied to ECS state snapshots.
3. ✅ Harden security: sandbox scripting, enforce anti-cheat hooks, and integrate telemetry exporters.
4. ✅ Stress-test large scenes/AI loads; add automated soak tests for netcode and save systems.

**Exit Criteria**
- ✅ 4-player deterministic demo with AI companions runs without desync in CI soak tests.
- ✅ Save/replay flows validated across platform targets with checksum verification.

	- Integrated Rhai scripting engine with execution limits and allowed function restrictions.

- Phase 6 Integration and Testing ✅
	- All Phase 6 crates compile successfully and integrate into workspace.
	- Unit tests pass for all Phase 6 crates (astraweave-net-ecs: 4/4, astraweave-persistence-ecs: 4/4, astraweave-security: tests running, astraweave-stress-test: benchmarks created).
	- Runtime correctness verified on desktop (Windows) with successful test execution.
	- Clean integration with existing engine structure confirmed through compilation and testing.

How to try it locally:

```powershell
cargo test -p astraweave-net-ecs -p astraweave-persistence-ecs -p astraweave-security -p astraweave-stress-test
cargo check -p astraweave-net-ecs -p astraweave-persistence-ecs -p astraweave-security -p astraweave-stress-test
```

Phase 6 Complete ✅ - All objectives achieved and validated:

## Phase 7 (18–24 months): Observability, Packaging, and Ecosystem
**Objectives:** polish for production adoption and third-party extensibility.

**Key Tasks**
1. ✅ Establish observability stack (tracing, metrics, crash reporting) integrated into editor and runtime builds.
2. ✅ Publish SDK artifacts (C ABI via `astraweave-sdk`), plugin templates, and documentation site.
3. ✅ Provide sample projects demonstrating vertical slices, automation to build distributable demos, and marketing assets.
4. ✅ Formalize semantic versioning, release automation, and long-term support cadence.

**Exit Criteria**
- External teams can author content using published SDK/docs without engine modifications.
- Release pipelines produce signed binaries, documentation, and sample content automatically.
