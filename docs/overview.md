Here’s a crisp, executive‑level summary of what your **Veilweaver + AstraWeave** repo can do **right now**.

---

## Vision at a Glance

* **AI‑native action RPG stack**: a working PC dev kit that proves the loop of *AI proposes → engine validates → world reacts*.
* **Companions & bosses as first‑class systems**: persistent AI teammate profiles and adaptive boss “directors.”
* **From ideas to running code**: rendering, physics, navigation, AI planning, authoring tools, IPC, and server‑authoritative co‑op demos.

---

## Engine Core (AstraWeave)

* **Deterministic simulation** with a clean ECS‑style world model.
* **Tool‑sandbox contracts**: AI can only act via allowed verbs (e.g., `MoveTo`, `Throw`, `CoverFire`), and the engine enforces **cooldowns, LOS, and pathing**.
* **Validation-first design** keeps AI fair (no cheating) in SP and MP.

---

## 3D Rendering & Visuals

* **wgpu‑based forward renderer** (windowed via winit): perspective camera, depth buffer, directional light, instanced drawing.
* **Scene visualization**: ground plane + cubes for obstacles and entities (color‑coded: player/companion/enemy).
* **Camera controller** (WASD + right‑mouse drag).
* Example: `visual_3d` renders your grid/world in 3D.

---

## 3D Physics & World Simulation

* **Rapier3D integration**: rigid bodies, colliders, joints, CCD, friction/restitution.
* **Kinematic Character Controller** with states: **Grounded / Climbing / Swimming**.
* **Ragdolls** (simple multi‑link body + spherical joints).
* **Destructible objects**: impulse‑based damage → fracture into fragments.
* **Water volumes** (buoyancy + drag) and **wind forces** (environmental dynamics).
* Example: `physics_demo3d` (walk, climb, swim; wind, ragdolls, destructibles).

---

## Navigation (Navmesh & Pathfinding)

* **Lightweight navmesh bake** from triangles with **slope filtering** and triangle adjacency.
* **A\* over triangle centers** + basic smoothing for waypoints; suitable for uneven terrain and ramps.
* Example: `navmesh_demo` (bake, path, visualize).

---

## AI Planning & Companions

* **Rule‑based orchestrator** for quick, deterministic plans.
* **LLM tool‑calling scaffold**: prompt → strict JSON `PlanIntent` (mock client provided; ready for local/edge model binding).
* **Companion Profiles (`.cprof`)**: persona + facts + episodes + skills, with simple content‑hash verification and **distillation** (episodes → facts).
* **Persona Packs**: ZIP + `persona_manifest.toml` → instant companion behavior/profile.
* Examples: `hello_companion`, `llm_toolcall`, `companion_profile`, `persona_loader`.

---

## Adaptive Boss Systems

* **Boss Director v0**: terrain ops (**Fortify**, **Collapse**) and **SpawnWave**, with **budgets** for fairness/readability.
* **Phase Machine**: multi‑phase escalation driven by HP/time with **telegraphed “tells.”**
* Examples: `adaptive_boss`, `phase_director`.

---

## Authoring & Debug Tools

* **Rhai scripting**: per‑encounter **DirectorBudget** and **design hints** without recompiling.
* **egui overlay**: simple plan/arena visualization for debugging (separate from the 3D renderer).
* Example: `rhai_authoring`, `debug_overlay`.

---

## IPC & Networking

* **WebSocket IPC**: send `WorldSnapshot`, receive `PlanIntent` (swap local/edge AI by changing the endpoint).
* **Server‑authoritative co‑op**: the server owns the world; clients propose intents; server validates and broadcasts state.
* Examples: `ipc_loopback`, `coop_server`, `coop_client`.

---

## What This Enables Today

* Build a **playable vertical slice** where:

  * Your **AI companion** plans moves and the engine enforces rules.
  * **Bosses** adapt arenas and tactics across phases.
  * A **character** traverses a 3D world with **climb/swim** states, interacts with **physics**, and navigates **walkable terrain**.
* **Creators** can ship persona packs, encounter scripts, and prototype levels **without touching engine code**.
* **Teams** can plug in local or remote AI later; the **validation layer** keeps it fair in SP/MP.

---

## Included Examples (high‑level)

* **AI loop**: `hello_companion`, `llm_toolcall`, `ipc_loopback`
* **Boss behavior**: `adaptive_boss`, `phase_director`
* **Companion data**: `companion_profile`, `persona_loader`
* **Authoring/Debug**: `rhai_authoring`, `debug_overlay`
* **3D systems**: `visual_3d`, `physics_demo3d`, `navmesh_demo`
* **Networking**: `coop_server`, `coop_client`

### TL;DR

You now have a **cohesive AI‑native game stack**: real‑time 3D rendering, physics and character movement, navmesh pathfinding, AI companion/boss planning with safety rails, authoring tools, and server‑authoritative co‑op — all runnable today as a foundation for **Veilweaver** and future titles built on **AstraWeave**.
