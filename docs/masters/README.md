### When to Update

- **MASTER_ROADMAP**: Completing phases, changing priorities, discovering gaps
- **MASTER_BENCHMARK_REPORT**: Performance changes >10%, new benchmarks
- **MASTER_COVERAGE_REPORT**: Coverage changes ±5% per-crate or ±2% overall

### Update Process

1. Open the relevant master report
2. Update the appropriate section with new data
3. Increment the version number in the header
4. Add an entry to the "Revision History" table

## Hard Rules

- ✅ ALWAYS check if master reports need updating after completing work
- ✅ ALWAYS update all three reports if thresholds exceeded
- ✅ ALWAYS increment version and add revision history entry
- ❌ NEVER skip master report updates
- ❌ NEVER let master reports become stale (>1 month without review)
