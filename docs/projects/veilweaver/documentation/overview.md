# Veilweaver Overview

Veilweaver is AstraWeave’s flagship AI-native action RPG: a twilight archipelago where players manipulate fate threads alongside a persistent AI companion. The new [`VEILWEAVER_VERTICAL_SLICE_PLAN.md`](../design-docs/VEILWEAVER_VERTICAL_SLICE_PLAN.md) defines a 30-minute playable slice that demonstrates the engine’s core pillars:

- **Fate-Weaving Traversal** — deterministic world state edits governed by the `astraweave-weaving` crate.
- **Companion Co-op AI** — GOAP + LLM hybrid behaviors showcasing persistent memory and adaptive support.
- **Adaptive Boss Director** — encounters that monitor player tactics and reconfigure arenas in real time.
