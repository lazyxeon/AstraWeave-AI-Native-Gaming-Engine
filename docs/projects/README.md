# Project Documentation

This directory consolidates project-specific documentation and assets that previously lived at the repository root.

- [console](console/) — AstraCore console concept notes and supporting material.
- [veilweaver](veilweaver/) — Veilweaver game design docs, supporting assets, and integration guides.

Add future project collections here instead of creating new root-level folders.
