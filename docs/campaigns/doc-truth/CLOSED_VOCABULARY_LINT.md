# Closed-Vocabulary Lint Spec — Documentation Truth campaign

**What this is.** Two closed vocabularies whose members are, by campaign decision, either *forbidden as a present-tense AstraWeave claim* (Vocab A poison strings) or *forbidden as provenance-free self-praise* (Vocab B superlatives). Unlike open-ended capability prose — which only the inventory sweep can audit — these are **closed sets**, so `git grep` is exhaustive where sampling is lossy (the D.1.A failure: it corrected `CLAUDE_MD_HARDENING:296` but missed the sibling at `:319`, and `COMPREHENSIVE:13` but missed `:1022`). This file is the authoritative spec the **D.3 regression lint** consumes; the evidence list of current occurrences is [`CLOSED_VOCABULARY_OCCURRENCES.md`](CLOSED_VOCABULARY_OCCURRENCES.md).

**Lint scope.** All tracked prose: `*.md` plus `gh-pages/**` (`.md`/`.html`/`_config.yml`), `.zencoder/**/*.md`, `.github/*.md`, per-crate `README.md`. **Excluded** (never linted): `docs/journey/**`, `docs/archive/**` (historical artifacts), `docs/campaigns/doc-truth/**` (this campaign's audit trail legitimately *quotes* the forbidden strings as evidence), `.github/copilot-instructions-old-backup.md`. Source-code comments are out of scope (a separate concern from prose).

**Lint posture (per the framework D.3 plan).** Warn-only for two weeks, then enforce. A match is a *candidate* violation; the keep-vs-act rule below defines the false-positive set the lint must allow (cited competitor figures, literal test params, registry-linked headlines, correctly-dated historical notes).

## Vocabulary A — poison strings (retired/fabricated values forbidden as current AstraWeave truth)

Seeded from the `CLAIMS_REGISTRY.md` Retired table + D.0 §4 + D.0.1 §5. Each is a value that is FABRICATED (delete) or STALE/superseded (correct/retire) per `D0_CLAIMS_INVENTORY.md` §1.2 ground truth.

## Keep-vs-act rule (the false-positive allowlist the lint must honor)

For each occurrence:

1. **Poison string asserting the value as current AstraWeave truth** → ACT per four-action: retired numbers DELETE or retire-to-registry; stale-with-§1.2-arbiter CORRECT (link the registry); aspirational REWRITE.
2. **Superlative describing AstraWeave** → remove the provenance-free adjective *surgically*; keep the factual remainder. "world-class geometry rendering but CPU-bound lighting" → drop "world-class", keep the rest. Deleting a superlative ≠ deleting the sentence.
3. **`production-ready` / `production-grade`** → **KEEP** where the surface is genuinely shipped and has production callers; **REWRITE-to-honest** where dormant / in-design / example-scoped. Not an auto-delete.
4. **KEEP byte-identical** when the occurrence is any of:
   - a **cited competitor figure** with provenance (e.g. the Reddit-sourced Unity DOTS "1 million entities" number; "Fyrox is the production-grade Rust+egui reference" — about a *competitor*, not AstraWeave);
   - a **literal test parameter** (e.g. `676` in `astraweave-ai/tests/planner_tests.rs`);
   - the **registry-homed headline** (`12,700` agents) **provided it links** to `CLAIMS_REGISTRY.md#agents-capacity-60fps` rather than restating a bare comparative;
   - a **correctly-dated historical note** in a campaign/audit doc that scopes itself to a past commit (e.g. F.0 audit findings under a "superseded by F.1" banner);
   - an occurrence inside the **excluded paths** (journey/archive/doc-truth/old-backup).

The union of acted + kept occurrences is the complete closed-vocabulary inventory. The lint flags any *new* occurrence (a string from A or B) that is not in the allowlist of rule 4.

## Frame-time carve-out (D.3.1) — why `2.70 ms` is NOT in Vocabulary A

The frame-time poison generation (`2.70 ms` / `370 FPS` / `84% headroom`, **as-achieved** — superseded by the measured System **0.965 ms** / mimalloc **0.709 ms** @ 1,000 entities; `CLAIMS_REGISTRY.md#frame-time-1000-entities`) is **deliberately excluded** from the closed-vocabulary lint, per the D.3.0 ratification (Option A).

**Why (it fails the closed-set test).** Unlike coverage/miri — whose superseded values (`59.3`, `94.57`, `977`) never legitimately recur except as a dated/superseded record — the string `2.70 ms` is, in the live corpus, *simultaneously*:

1. the **sanctioned reframing** ("2.70 ms was the Week-8 *target*"), which must keep the string (≈10 sites: README, render README, gh-pages ×3, docs/src/README, MASTER_ROADMAP ×3, MASTER_BENCHMARK ×3);
2. a **labeled target** (`gh-pages/benchmarks.md`);
3. a **dated achievement record** (Week-8 sprint rows across `docs/lessons/**`, `docs/audits/**`);
4. a **false positive** (Vec3-lerp `2.70 ns`, deserialize `2.70 ms` in `.bak`, `num_batch 2700ms`);
5. genuine **present-tense poison**.

A pure string match cannot separate (5) from (1)–(3). Listing it would either need ~30+ allowlist keys (mostly in dated docs → low signal) or chronically false-positive, eroding the warn→enforce credibility. So frame-time is **human-review-only**, not lint-enforced.

**Baseline already established.** The present-tense frame-time survivors were one-time-corrected in D.3.1: `.zencoder/rules/repo.md:84` and `docs/lessons/WHAT_DIDNT.md:21` (the bare "**Current**:" claim). Dated Week-8 records (e.g. `docs/lessons/PERFORMANCE_PATTERNS.md` "Current Status (Week 8)" block at :62–73) were left byte-identical per the per-row principle (correcting a dated record falsifies history).

**Documented alternative (Option B, not adopted).** A standing frame-time guard is possible via a *same-line-context* rule — flag `2.70 ms`/`2.7 ms`/`2.70ms` only on lines lacking `target`/`Week 8`/`Week-8` — at the cost of ~12 allowlist keys for the dated audits/lessons that assert it present-tense without those words. Revisit only if a frame-time regression recurs.

## Revision history

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 (D.1.B) | 2026-06-13 | Created. Vocab A (poison) + Vocab B (superlative) sets seeded from the registry Retired table + D.0/D.0.1 dispositions; keep-vs-act rule + exclusion scope defined for D.3 lint consumption. Pre-edit occurrence totals: 501 A + 415 B across 202 files (see occurrences doc). |
| 0.2 (D.3.1) | 2026-06-29 | **New poison generation + machine-readable markers.** Added the D.2.B/Path-B.2 measured-metric poison to Vocab A: coverage `59.3`/`59.3%` + `94.57`/`94.57%` (→ 57.35% whole-workspace) and miri `977` (→ 1,059). Added the **Frame-time carve-out** (ratified Option A — `2.70 ms`/`370 FPS` deliberately NOT linted; human-review-only; present-tense survivors one-time-corrected). Wrapped Vocab A / Vocab B in `<!-- VOCAB-A/B-START/END -->` markers (and the allowlist table in `<!-- ALLOWLIST-START/END -->`) so the D.3.2 lint reads this spec as its single source of truth. Companion allowlist additions: 14 keys (supersession-context / version-comparison / debunking-context / dated-record / report-description). Authority: `D3_0_RECON.md`. |
