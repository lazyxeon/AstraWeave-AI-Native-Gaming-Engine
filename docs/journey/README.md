# The AstraWeave Journey: 40+ Days to Production

## Overview

This directory documents the complete development journey of AstraWeave, the world's first fully AI-orchestrated game engine built as part of the Genesis Code Protocol (GCP) experiment.

**Timeline**: October 14, 2025 - Present (40+ days and counting)  
**Result**: Production-ready AI-native game engine  
**Methodology**: AI orchestration with systematic validation  
**Evidence**: Every decision, every optimization, every bug fix documented

## Why This Documentation Exists

This is not just a game engine. **It's a proof-of-concept that AI can build production-grade systems when properly orchestrated.**

This documentation serves as:
- **Evidence** of the systematic 40-day development timeline
- **Case study** for AI orchestration methodology (Genesis Code Protocol)
- **Learning resource** for developers attempting similar AI-driven projects  
- **Validation** that the "AI coding experiment" actually works in practice
- **Historical record** of how an AI (GitHub Copilot) built a game engine iteratively
