## Coverage Gap Analysis

### Gap 1: tools.rs (35/121 = 28.93%) - **MAJOR GAP**

**Uncovered Lines**: 86 lines (70.25% of file)

**Uncovered Functions**:
- Complex pathfinding logic
- Line-of-sight computations
- Navmesh integration
- Helper utilities

**Tests Needed**: ~8-12 tests (1-1.5h)

**Impact**: +7-9pp Core coverage (86 lines / 1,179 total)

---

### Gap 2: perception.rs (0/24 = 0%) - **MAJOR GAP**

**Uncovered Lines**: 24 lines (100% of file)

**Uncovered Functions**:
- Perception snapshot building
- Sensor aggregation
- Visibility checks

**Tests Needed**: ~3-4 tests (30-45 min)

**Impact**: +2pp Core coverage (24 lines / 1,179 total)

---

### Gap 3: validation.rs (50/197 = 25.38%) - **MODERATE GAP**

**Uncovered Lines**: 147 lines (74.62% of file)

**Breakdown**:
- ✅ Core actions covered (MoveTo, Attack, Heal, Reload, ThrowSmoke, Throw, CoverFire, Revive)
- ⏸️ Stub implementations (37+ ActionStep variants with logging only, no logic to test)

**Tests Needed**: ~0-2 tests (stub implementations have no validation logic)

**Impact**: +0-2pp Core coverage (stubs are low-value)

**Note**: 147 uncovered lines are mostly stub match arms like:
```rust
ActionStep::Approach { target_id, distance } => {
    log(format!("  [{}] APPROACH #{} at distance {:.1}", i, target_id, distance));
    // Implementation stub
}
```

These stubs have no validation logic to test beyond logging. Coverage would be cosmetic.

---

### Gap 4: ECS Bridge/Components/Events (19/57 = 33.33%) - **MODERATE GAP**

**Uncovered Lines**: 38 lines

**Breakdown**:
- ecs_bridge.rs: 5/31 (16.13%)
- ecs_components.rs: 4/10 (40%)
- ecs_events.rs: 10/16 (62.5%)

**Tests Needed**: ~4-6 tests (45-60 min)

**Impact**: +3-4pp Core coverage (38 lines / 1,179 total)

---

### Gap 5: tool_sandbox.rs (10/46 = 21.74%) - **MODERATE GAP**

**Uncovered Lines**: 36 lines

**Tests Needed**: ~3-4 tests (30-45 min)

**Impact**: +3pp Core coverage (36 lines / 1,179 total)

---

## Total Gap to 80% Target

**Current**: 68.53%

---

## Why Did We Fall Short?

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue 1: Overestimated Initial Coverage of Target Files**

- **Assumption**: schema.rs/validation.rs had 0% coverage
- **Reality**: 
  - tool_vocabulary.rs was already 99.83% (573/574 lines)
  - ecs_adapter.rs was already 85.19% (46/54 lines)
  - world.rs was already 80% (40/50 lines)
  - capture_replay.rs was already 83.33% (20/24 lines)

**Impact**: 683 lines (57.9% of Core) were already well-tested, leaving less "easy wins"

---

**Issue 2: validation.rs Stub Implementations**

- **Assumption**: validation.rs had 457 lines of testable logic
- **Reality**: validation.rs has 197 lines, of which **147 lines are stub match arms with no validation logic**

**Impact**: Only 50 lines of validation.rs are realistically testable (25.38% coverage achieved)

---

**Issue 3: Major Gaps in Untouched Files**

- **tools.rs**: 86 uncovered lines (70.25% of file) - complex pathfinding/LoS logic
- **perception.rs**: 24 uncovered lines (100% of file) - sensor/visibility logic
- **ecs_bridge/components/events**: 38 uncovered lines - ECS integration

**Impact**: 148 lines (12.5% of Core) in specialized files not addressed by Tasks 5-6

---

### What Went Right

✅ **Extreme Efficiency**: 1h vs 4.5-6h estimate (78-83% under budget)  
✅ **Strategic Targeting**: Focused on AI planning core (schema, validation)  
✅ **Zero Regressions**: All 40 tests passing  
✅ **Knowledge Reuse**: Week 1 patterns accelerated development 4-5×  
✅ **High-Value Coverage**: WorldSnapshot, PlanIntent, ActionStep, core validation patterns all covered

---

### What Could Be Improved

⚠️ **Broader File Coverage**: Should have added tools.rs/perception.rs tests  
⚠️ **Tarpaulin Early**: Should have run tarpaulin after Task 5 to adjust course  
⚠️ **Gap Analysis Accuracy**: Overestimated testable lines in validation.rs  

---

## Strategic Decision Point

### Option A: Defer Task 7, Proceed to Week 3 (ECS) - **RECOMMENDED**

**Rationale**:
- Week 2 added 21 tests covering **AI planning core** (WorldSnapshot, PlanIntent, ActionStep, validation)
- Remaining 11.47pp gap is in **specialized files** (tools.rs pathfinding, perception.rs sensors, ECS bridge)
- Week 3 (ECS crate) has **higher ROI** for Scenario 3 target (70.03% → 80% = +9.97pp)
- Can revisit Core gap after Scenario 3 completion

**Benefits**:
- Proceed to Week 3 immediately (momentum preservation)
- Focus on ECS crate (higher baseline, easier 80% target)
- Defer Core gap closure to post-Scenario 3 cleanup

**Downsides**:
- Core crate finishes at 68.53% (not 80%)
- Scenario 3 average will be lower (~74-76% vs 80% target)

**Timeline**: Week 3 starts now, Core gap addressed in follow-up sprint

---

### Option B: Complete Task 7 Now (Small Files Expansion)

**Target**: Add 15-22 tests to close 11.47pp gap

**Files**:
- tools.rs: 8-12 tests (1-1.5h)
- perception.rs: 3-4 tests (30-45 min)
- ecs_bridge/components/events: 4-6 tests (45-60 min)

**Total Time**: 2.25-3.25 hours

**Benefits**:
- Core crate reaches 80% target
- Scenario 3 average improves to ~78-79%
- Complete Week 2 fully

**Downsides**:
- Additional 2.25-3.25h investment (total Week 2: 3.25-4.25h)
- Delays Week 3 start
- Lower ROI than ECS crate work

**Timeline**: Complete Task 7 today, Week 3 starts tomorrow

---

## Recommendation: Option A (Defer & Proceed)

**Justification**:
1. **Campaign Goal**: Scenario 3 aims for **80% average across 3 crates**, not 80% each crate
2. **Current Status**: AI (75-85%), Core (68.53%), ECS (70.03%) = **~71-74% average**
3. **Best ROI**: ECS has easiest path to 80% (70.03% baseline, +9.97pp needed)
4. **Time Efficiency**: Week 2 took 1h vs 4.5-6h estimate - momentum is strong
5. **Value Delivered**: Core AI planning types (WorldSnapshot, PlanIntent, ActionStep) fully covered

**Plan**:
- Mark Week 2 as **PARTIAL COMPLETION** (68.53% vs 80% target)
- Proceed to Week 3 (ECS crate) immediately
- Revisit Core gap in **Scenario 3 cleanup sprint** (post-Week 3)

**Revised Scenario 3 Target**:
- AI: 75-85% (achieved)
- Core: 68.53% (partial)
- ECS: 80% (target)
- **Average**: ~74-78% (vs 80% original target, **-2-6pp shortfall**)

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Run Tarpaulin Early

- **Issue**: Waited until end of Week 2 to validate coverage
- **Impact**: Couldn't course-correct after Task 5
- **Fix**: Run tarpaulin after each task for real-time feedback

---

### Lesson 2: Validate Gap Analysis Assumptions

- **Issue**: Assumed validation.rs had 457 lines, actually 197 lines (147 stubs)
- **Impact**: Overestimated testable surface area
- **Fix**: Read full file before estimating coverage potential

---

### Lesson 3: Prioritize High-LOC Files

- **Issue**: Focused on schema/validation, missed tools.rs (121 lines)
- **Impact**: Left largest gap unaddressed (86 uncovered lines)
- **Fix**: Sort files by uncovered LOC, target top 2-3 first

---

### Lesson 4: Stub Implementations Have Low Coverage Value

- **Issue**: validation.rs has 147 lines of logging-only stubs
- **Impact**: Coverage gain is cosmetic (tests just call stubs)
- **Fix**: Defer stub testing until implementation exists

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 3 Start)

**Target**: ECS crate improvement (70.03% → 80%)

**Tasks**:
1. **Task 9**: ECS additional tests (20-30 tests, 2-3h → likely 1-1.5h)
2. **Task 10**: ECS validation & report (1h → likely 30 min)
3. **Task 11**: P1-A campaign summary (1-2h → likely 45 min)
4. **Task 12**: Documentation archive (0.5-1h → likely 15-30 min)

**Timeline**: Week 3 (2-3h projected)

---

### Post-Scenario 3 (Core Gap Closure)

**Target**: Core 68.53% → 80% (+11.47pp)

**Tasks**:
- tools.rs tests (8-12 tests, 1-1.5h)
- perception.rs tests (3-4 tests, 30-45 min)
- ecs_bridge/components/events tests (4-6 tests, 45-60 min)

**Timeline**: Follow-up sprint (2.25-3.25h)
