## Metrics Summary

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Scene Coverage** | 0.00% | **48.54%** | +48.54pp |
| **Scene Tests** | 30 inline | **23 integration** | 7 skipped |
| **Measured Crates** | 12 | **13** | +8% |
| **Total Tests** | 1,225 | **1,248** | +23 |
| **Overall Coverage** | 75.14% | **74.35%** | -0.79pp |
| **P1-C Measured** | 0/5 | **1/6** | +1 crate |

**Note**: Overall coverage decreased slightly because Scene (48.54%) is below the previous 75% average, pulling down the weighted mean. This is expected and acceptable.
