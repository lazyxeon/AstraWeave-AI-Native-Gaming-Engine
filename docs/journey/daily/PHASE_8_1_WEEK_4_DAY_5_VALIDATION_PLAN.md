## 3. Validation Procedure

### 3.1 Manual Testing Steps

**Setup**:
```powershell
# Build demo in release mode for accurate performance
cargo build -p ui_menu_demo --release

# Run demo
cargo run -p ui_menu_demo --release
```

**Test Execution**:
1. Click "New Game" to enter in-game state
2. Execute each test case in order (H1-H12, D1-D10, N1-N14, M1-M14)
3. Record results in validation report (PASS/FAIL)
4. For failures, document observed behavior vs expected
5. Execute integration tests (I1-I10)
6. Validate user acceptance criteria (UA1-UA8)

**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ 50+ manual tests: ‚â•95% pass rate (‚â§2 failures acceptable)
- ‚úÖ 10 integration tests: 100% pass rate
- ‚úÖ 8 UAT criteria: 100% pass rate
- ‚úÖ Zero clippy warnings (already validated)

---

### 3.2 Performance Benchmarking

**Metrics to Collect**:

1. **Frame Time** (target: <16.67ms @ 60 FPS)
   - Baseline: HUD hidden
   - Week 4 Features: All active (health anim + damage + notification + minimap zoom/ping)
   - Stress Test: Spam all keys for 30 seconds

2. **Memory Usage** (target: <10 MB for HUD)
   - Measure before/after Week 4 features
   - Check for leaks (no growth over 5 minutes)

3. **Rendering Cost** (per-feature breakdown)
   - Health animations: <0.5ms
   - Damage numbers (20 concurrent): <1.0ms
   - Notifications (3 queued): <0.5ms
   - Minimap (10 POIs + 5 pings): <1.0ms

**Tools**:
- FPS counter in ui_menu_demo (already implemented)
- Windows Task Manager for memory monitoring
- Manual observation (smooth 60 FPS = pass)

---

### 3.3 Bug Triage

**If bugs are found**:

**P0 (Critical - Fix Immediately)**:
- Crashes, panics, or unwrap() failures
- Visual corruption or rendering failures
- Complete feature non-functional

**P1 (High - Fix Before Day 5 Complete)**:
- Visual glitches (e.g., incorrect colors, clipping)
- Performance issues (FPS drops below 60)
- Usability problems (controls unresponsive)

**P2 (Medium - Document for Future)**:
- Minor visual inconsistencies
- Edge cases (e.g., 100√ó pings spawned)
- Documentation gaps

**P3 (Low - Optional)**:
- Code cleanup opportunities
- Future enhancement ideas
- Non-critical warnings

## 6. Risk Assessment

### 6.1 Known Risks

**R1: High Test Count (50+ manual)**
- **Risk**: Manual testing fatigue leading to false negatives
- **Mitigation**: Break into 4 batches (12+10+14+14), 5-minute breaks between
- **Impact**: LOW (tests are fast, ~2 min each)

**R2: Performance Variation**
- **Risk**: FPS fluctuates based on system load (background apps)
- **Mitigation**: Close non-essential apps, run 3√ó and average results
- **Impact**: LOW (demo is lightweight, 60 FPS easily maintained)

**R3: Visual Judgment Subjectivity**
- **Risk**: "Smooth animation" is subjective, may vary per tester
- **Mitigation**: Define objective criteria (e.g., "no visible stuttering at 60 FPS")
- **Impact**: LOW (pass/fail criteria are clear)

**R4: Potential P0 Bugs**
- **Risk**: Critical bug found requires immediate fix, delaying Day 5
- **Mitigation**: Week 4 features already validated individually (Days 1-4)
- **Impact**: VERY LOW (4 days of incremental validation minimizes risk)

## 7. Next Steps After Validation

**If 100% Pass**:
1. Create PHASE_8_1_WEEK_4_COMPLETE.md summary
2. Update copilot instructions with Week 4 achievements
3. Mark Week 4 as COMPLETE in todo list
4. Plan Week 5 (optional polish or transition to next priority)

**If <95% Pass**:
1. Triage failures (P0-P3)
2. Fix P0/P1 bugs immediately
3. Re-run failed tests
4. Update validation report with fixes
5. Proceed to Week 4 summary once ‚â•95% achieved

**If Critical Issues (P0)**:
1. Stop validation process
2. Fix critical bug immediately
3. Re-run full test suite
4. Escalate if multiple P0s found (unlikely)

**Plan Status**: ‚úÖ READY  
**Next Action**: Execute manual test suite (50 tests)  
**Author**: GitHub Copilot (AI-generated, zero human code)
