## Key Learnings & Discoveries

### 1. ActionStep Enum Discovery (Day 2) 🔍

**Problem**: 8 compilation errors due to treating ActionStep as struct

**Root Cause**: ActionStep is **enum, not struct** — requires pattern matching

**Solution**:
```rust
// ✅ CORRECT
match step {
    ActionStep::MoveTo { x, y, .. } => { /* ... */ }
    ActionStep::Attack { target_id } => { /* ... */ }
    _ => {}
}

// ❌ WRONG
if step.tool == "MoveTo" {  // Error: no field `tool`
    let x = step.x;          // Error: no field `x`
}
```

**Impact**: Documented in API guide (Day 4) to prevent future mistakes

---

### 2. Week 8 Optimization Validation (Day 3) 🚀

**Finding**: 46-65% AI performance improvements since last benchmark run

**Root Cause**: Week 8 optimization sprint delivered on promises:
