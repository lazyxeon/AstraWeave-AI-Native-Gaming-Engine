## 💡 Key Insights from Analysis

### 1. P0 Success Pattern ✅

**Completed**: 5 crates, 86.85% average, 11.5 hours work

**Success Factors**:
- 3/5 crates already had excellent tests (nav 100%, behavior 78%, math 87%)
- Only 2/5 needed significant work (audio 10h, physics 1.5h)
- Strategic discoveries saved 24+ hours

**Lesson**: **Measure before planning** - many crates may already have good coverage

---

### 2. P1-A Better Than Expected ✅

**Estimated**: 35-50% average (from baseline)  
**Actual**: 60.71% average (21pp better!)

**Root Cause**: Baseline report used workspace-wide measurement (same error as P0)

**Lesson**: **Always use scoped tarpaulin** to avoid false negatives

---

### 3. Realistic Time Estimates 📊

**Based on P0 campaign**:
- Build from 0-20%: 6-8 hours per crate
- Build from 20-50%: 3-5 hours per crate
- Build from 50-70%: 1-3 hours per crate
- Discovery (already >70%): 0.25-0.5 hours

**With 30% discovery rate** (like P0): Save 50-75 hours

**Realistic Total**: **133-212 hours** (17-27 working days) for all 47 crates

---

### 4. Prioritization Matters 🎯

**Critical Path** (must achieve):
1. P0 crates (core engine) ← ✅ COMPLETE
2. P1-A crates (ECS/AI/Core) ← 🎯 CURRENT
3. P1-B crates (rendering/scene) ← Next
4. P1-C/D crates (UI/gameplay) ← After rendering
5. P2/P3 crates (advanced/tooling) ← Lower priority

**Timeline to Industry Standard**: 10-15 working days (P0 + P1 only)

---

## 🎓 Lessons from P0 Campaign (Apply to All Phases)

1. ✅ **Measure first, plan second** - Avoid false negatives from bad baselines
2. ✅ **Scoped tarpaulin always** - `--include-files "<crate>/src/**"`
3. ✅ **Check existing tests** - 30% of crates may already be complete
4. ✅ **Recognize diminishing returns** - <2pp/hour = accept and move on
5. ✅ **Focus on genuine gaps** - Per-file analysis reveals true needs
6. ✅ **Breadth-first strategy** - Cover all critical crates before perfecting one
