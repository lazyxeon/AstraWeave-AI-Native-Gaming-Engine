## Summary by Bucket

| Bucket | Estimated Lines | % of Original |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| KEEP-INSTRUCTIONS | ~290 | 20% |
| KEEP-REFERENCE | ~235 | 16% |
| RELOCATE-STATUS | ~460 | 32% |
| RELOCATE-INDEX | ~194 | 13% |
| RELOCATE-HISTORY | (embedded in STATUS) | — |
| DUPLICATE | ~45 | 3% |
| Overhead (headers/breaks) | ~225 | 16% |

**Key finding**: Only ~36% of the file (KEEP-INSTRUCTIONS + KEEP-REFERENCE) is behavioral or reference content. The remaining ~64% is status dashboards, historical records, and documentation indexes that dilute every prompt.

## Duplicates Found

1. **Determinism Validation COMPLETE** — appears at lines ~79-83 AND lines ~88-101 (two different detail levels)
2. **Phase B Month 4 Integration COMPLETE** — appears at lines ~84-86 AND lines ~103-114
3. **Chain of Thought Process** — appears at lines ~476-483 (short) AND lines ~490-520 (long)
4. **Error Handling Policy** — appears at lines ~484-488 AND lines ~1195-1200
5. **Phase 8 roadmap content** — appears in "Current State" AND in "Next Steps" section
