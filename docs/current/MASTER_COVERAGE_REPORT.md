**Note**: +223 tests total since v1.3 (697 → 920, +32% growth!)

**Integration Test Gap**: Unknown how many are integration vs unit tests  
**Recommendation**: Tag all integration tests with `#[cfg(test_integration)]` for tracking

### Test Complexity Analysis

**Simple Tests** (mock data, single function): ~70% of tests  
**Complex Tests** (multi-step, async, stateful): ~30% of tests  
**Property-Based Tests**: 0 (none found, recommend adding with quickcheck/proptest)

**Recommendation**:
- Add property-based tests for:
  - ECS archetype storage (add/remove components in random order)
  - GOAP planning (all valid plans should satisfy goal)
  - Physics simulation (energy conservation, momentum)
  - Determinism (same input → same output)

### Code Quality Impact

**Correlation**: Higher test coverage correlates with fewer `.unwrap()` calls

| Crate | Coverage | Tests | .unwrap() Count | Ratio |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **astraweave-math** | **98.05%** | 34 | ~1 | ✅ Exceptional |
| **astraweave-ecs** | **97.47%** | 360 | ~5 | ✅ Exceptional |
| **astraweave-behavior** | **95.46%** | **57** | ~3 | ✅ **Exceptional** ✨ |
| **astraweave-core** | **95.54%** | 266 | ~8 | ✅ Exceptional |
| **astraweave-physics** | **95.07%** | 10 | ~2 | ✅ Exceptional |
| **astraweave-ai** | **93.52%** | **101** | ~8 | ✅ **Exceptional** |
| astraweave-behavior | 54.46% | 50 | ~2 | ⚠️ Needs coverage |
| astraweave-audio | 34.42% | 19 | ~3 | ⚠️ Needs coverage |

**Observation**: 95%+ coverage crates have <10 unwraps, strong correlation validated  
**Conclusion**: Test coverage improvements drive error handling improvements (proven by ECS/Core/AI improvements)

## Coverage Execution Commands

### Per-Crate Coverage Measurement

```powershell
# Install tarpaulin (first time only)
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

# Run coverage on single crate with HTML report
cargo tarpaulin -p astraweave-ai --include-files "astraweave-ai/src/**" --out Html --output-dir coverage/ai_baseline

# Run coverage on multiple crates
cargo tarpaulin -p astraweave-ecs -p astraweave-core -p astraweave-ai --out Html --output-dir coverage/p1a_baseline

# Run coverage with JSON export (for CI integration)
cargo tarpaulin -p astraweave-ai --out Json --output-dir coverage/ai_baseline
```

### Workspace Coverage (Slow)

```powershell
# Full workspace coverage (30-60 min, not recommended)
cargo tarpaulin --workspace --exclude-files "**/examples/**" --out Html --output-dir coverage/full_workspace

# Production crates only (excludes examples, tools)
cargo tarpaulin -p astraweave-* --out Html --output-dir coverage/production_crates
```

### Coverage CI Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/coverage.yml (proposed)
