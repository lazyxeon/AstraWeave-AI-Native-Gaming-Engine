**Measured With**: cargo-llvm-cov 0.6.21  
**Total Production Crates**: 47

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive baseline measurement of test coverage across all 47 production crates in the AstraWeave game engine. Coverage was measured using `cargo llvm-cov --lib` which provides source-level line coverage.

### Overall Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Crates** | 47 |
| **Excellent (≥90%)** | 11 (23.4%) |
| **Good (70-89%)** | 6 (12.8%) |
| **Needs Work (50-69%)** | 4 (8.5%) |
| **Critical (<50%)** | 26 (55.3%) |
| **Weighted Average** | ~53% (estimated) |

### Key Findings

1. **Core Infrastructure is Strong**: ECS, math, physics, and core systems have excellent coverage (78-98%)
2. **LLM Support is Mixed**: Some crates excellent (embeddings 98%, memory 93%), others critical (persona 14%, rag 24%)
3. **Rendering is Underserved**: Main render crate at 36%, UI at 20%
4. **New/Experimental Crates Need Tests**: 6 crates at 0% coverage
5. **Network Layer Critical**: Both net (24%) and net-ecs (38%) need attention

## Coverage Caps Analysis

Some crates have structural limitations that prevent achieving 90%+ coverage:

### GPU-Dependent Crates (Cap: 50-60%)

- **astraweave-render**: Requires GPU context for integration tests
- **astraweave-fluids**: GPU simulation, limited testability
- **astraweave-audio**: Hardware audio dependencies

### Network I/O Crates (Cap: 60-70%)

- **astraweave-net**: Async network operations
- **astraweave-net-ecs**: Network + ECS integration
- **astraweave-ipc**: Inter-process communication

### LLM Integration Crates (Cap: 70-75%)

- **astraweave-rag**: Depends on embedding models
- **astraweave-context**: LLM context management
- **astraweave-llm-eval**: Evaluation requires LLM responses

### FFI/SDK Crates (Cap: 60%)

- **astraweave-sdk**: C FFI bindings
- **astraweave-scripting**: Rhai integration

## Fixes Applied During Audit

### 1. astraweave-observability: Async Deadlock Fix

**Issue**: `RequestTracker::complete()` held DashMap guard across `.await` point  
**Fix**: Extract data before async operations  
**File**: `astraweave-observability/src/llm_telemetry.rs`

```rust
// Before: Guard held across await (deadlock)
let active_request = self.telemetry.active_requests.get(&self.request_id)?;
// ... create trace using active_request ...
self.telemetry.record_request(trace).await  // DEADLOCK

// After: Extract data first
let prompt_tokens = {
    let active_request = self.telemetry.active_requests.get(&self.request_id)?;
    active_request.prompt_tokens
}; // Guard dropped
// ... create trace using prompt_tokens ...
self.telemetry.record_request(trace).await  // OK
```

### 2. astraweave-ai: Environment Variable Test Isolation

**Issue**: Tests manipulating env vars racing in parallel  
**Fix**: Added `serial_test` crate and `#[serial]` attribute  
**File**: `astraweave-ai/src/orchestrator.rs`

```rust
use serial_test::serial;

#[test]
#[serial]
fn system_orchestrator_config_respects_ollama_model_env() {
    std::env::set_var("OLLAMA_MODEL", "llama3:70b");
    // ...
}
```

2. **Persistence Sprint**: persistence-ecs (27%), asset (49%)
3. **Network Sprint**: net (24%), net-ecs (38%)

### Medium-Term (Months 2-3)

1. **Rendering Tests**: Add mock GPU context infrastructure
2. **Audio Tests**: Abstract hardware dependencies
3. **Integration Tests**: Cross-crate test suites
