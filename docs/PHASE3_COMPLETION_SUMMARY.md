## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Incremental Development**: Building one system at a time with tests
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: Writing tests before/during implementation
3. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Well-defined goals from the start
4. **Determinism Focus**: Fixed seeds and stable iteration from Day 1
5. **Documentation-First**: READMEs and architecture docs concurrent with code

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Dependency Management**: rand/rand_chacha conflict took time to resolve
2. **Feature Flag Planning**: Some confusion about when to use feature gates
3. **Demo Scope**: Initial plans were more complex than necessary
4. **Parallel Development**: Some systems blocked others unnecessarily

### Best Practices Established
1. Always use BTreeMap/BTreeSet for deterministic order
2. Fixed seeds in all tests and demos
3. Comprehensive README for each demo/system
4. Integration tests for cross-system interactions
5. Regular compilation checks during development

## Next Steps (Phase 4+)

While Phase 3 is complete, here are recommended future enhancements:

### Short-Term (Optional Polish)
- Clean up demo warnings with `cargo fix`
- Runtime test all demos for visual validation
- Add interactive controls to demos (keyboard input)
- Create video recordings of demo runs

### Phase 4 Preparation
- Advanced AI features (HTN planning, LLM integration)
- Behavior tree visual editor
- GOAP planner visualization
- AI debugging tools

### Phase 5 and Beyond
- Multiplayer networking integration
- Save/load with AI state serialization
- Performance optimization and profiling
- Cross-platform validation (Linux, macOS)
