One example of procedural generation, here using [L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system "L-system") to generate realistic looking tree models. Different models can be generated by changing both deterministic parameters and a random seed.

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), **procedural generation** is a method of creating data [algorithmically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated content and algorithms coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power. In [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics"), it is commonly used to create [textures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_texture "Procedural texture") and [3D models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_models "3D models"). In video games, it is used to automatically create large amounts of content in a game. Depending on the implementation, advantages of procedural generation can include smaller file sizes, larger amounts of content, and randomness for less predictable gameplay.

The term _procedural_ refers to the process that computes a particular function. [Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal") are geometric patterns which can often be generated procedurally. Commonplace procedural content includes [textures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping "Texture mapping") and [meshes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh "Polygon mesh"). [Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound "Sound") is often also procedurally generated, and has applications in both [speech synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis "Speech synthesis") as well as music. It has been used to create compositions in various genres of [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music") by artists such as [Brian Eno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno "Brian Eno") who popularized the term "[generative music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music "Generative music")".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-1)

Procedurally generated [textures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping "Texture mapping")

Procedural generation was originally created as an instrument for video games, aiding in generating levels, textures and complete worlds with little human contribution. Procedurally generated elements have appeared in video games since the 1990s: _[The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Elder\_Scrolls\_II:\_Daggerfall "The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall")_ takes place in a mostly procedurally generated world, giving a world roughly two thirds the actual size of the [British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles "British Isles"). _[Soldier of Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier\_of\_Fortune\_(video\_game) "Soldier of Fortune (video game)")_ from [Raven Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_Software "Raven Software") uses simple routines to detail enemy models, while [its sequel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_of_Fortune_II:_Double_Helix "Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix") featured a randomly generated level mode. [Avalanche Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_Studios "Avalanche Studios") employed procedural generation to create a large and varied group of detailed tropical islands for _[Just Cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just\_Cause\_(video\_game) "Just Cause (video game)")_. _[No Man's Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\_Man%27s\_Sky "No Man's Sky")_, a game developed by games studio [Hello Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Games "Hello Games"), is all based upon procedurally generated elements.

The modern [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene "Demoscene") uses procedural generation to package a great deal of audiovisual content into relatively small programs.

New methods and applications are presented annually in conferences such as the [IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Conference_on_Computational_Intelligence_and_Games "IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games") and the [AAAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAI "AAAI") Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-2)

Particularly in the application of procedural generation with video games, which are intended to be highly replayable, there are concerns that procedural systems can generate infinite numbers of worlds to explore, but without sufficient human guidance and rules to guide these. The result has been called "procedural oatmeal", a term coined by writer Kate Compton, in that while it is possible to mathematically generate thousands of bowls of oatmeal with procedural generation, they will be perceived to be the same by the user, and lack the notion of perceived uniqueness that a procedural system should aim for.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-3)

In tabletop role-playing games
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Procedural_generation&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: In tabletop role-playing games")]

Using procedural generation in games had origins in tabletop role playing games (RPG).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-4) The leading tabletop system, _[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced\_Dungeons\_%26\_Dragons "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons")_, provided ways for the "dungeon master" to generate dungeons and terrain using random die rolls, expanded in later editions with complex branching procedural tables. [Strategic Simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Simulations "Strategic Simulations") under license from [TSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSR_(company) "TSR (company)") released the _[Dungeon Master's Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon\_Master%27s\_Assistant\_Volume\_I "Dungeon Master's Assistant Volume I")_, a computer program that generated dungeons based on these published tables. _[Tunnels & Trolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels\_%26\_Trolls "Tunnels & Trolls")_, published by [Flying Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Buffalo "Flying Buffalo"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-5) was designed primarily around solitary play and used similar procedural generation for its dungeons. Other tabletop RPGs borrowed similar concepts in procedural generation for various world elements.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-6)

Many online tools for Dungeon Masters now use procedural generation to varying degrees.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Prior to graphically oriented video games, [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike "Roguelike") games, a genre directly inspired by _Dungeons & Dragons_ adopted for solitary play, heavily utilized procedural generation to randomly produce dungeons, in the same manner that tabletop systems had done. Such early games include _[Beneath Apple Manor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneath\_Apple\_Manor "Beneath Apple Manor")_ (1978) and the genre's namesake, _[Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue\_(video\_game) "Rogue (video game)")_ (1980). The procedural generation system in roguelikes would create dungeons in [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII")- or regular tile-based systems and define rooms, hallways, monsters, and treasure to challenge the player. Roguelikes, and games based on the roguelike concepts, allow the development of complex gameplay without having to spend excessive time in creating a game's world.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-gamespy_roguelikes-7)

1978's _[Maze Craze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze\_Craze "Maze Craze")_ for the Atari VCS used an algorithm to generate a random, top-down maze for each game.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-8)

Some games used [pseudorandom number generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator "Pseudorandom number generator"). These PRNGs were often used with predefined [seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed "Random seed") values in order to generate very large game worlds that appeared to be premade. _[The Sentinel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sentinel\_(computer\_game) "The Sentinel (computer game)")_ supposedly had 10,000 different levels stored in only 48 and 64 kilobytes. An extreme case was _[Elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite\_(video\_game) "Elite (video game)")_, which was originally planned to contain a total of 2 48 (approximately 282 trillion) galaxies with 256 solar systems each. However, the publisher was afraid that such a gigantic universe would cause disbelief in players, and eight of these galaxies were chosen for the final version.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-masters-9) Other notable early examples include the 1985 game _[Rescue on Fractalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue\_on\_Fractalus "Rescue on Fractalus")_ (that used fractals to procedurally create, in real time, the craggy mountains of an alien planet) and _[River Raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River\_Raid "River Raid")_ (the 1982 [Activision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision "Activision") game that used a pseudorandom number sequence generated by a [linear feedback shift register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_feedback_shift_register "Linear feedback shift register") in order to generate a scrolling maze of obstacles).

Though modern computer games do not have the same memory and hardware restrictions that earlier games had, the use of procedural generation is frequently employed to create randomized games, maps, levels, characters, or other facets that are unique on each playthrough.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-11)

Many modern roguelike games (sometimes referred to as "roguelites") have shifted away from the turn-based early roguelikes to incorporate gameplay of other video game genres, such as [platformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platformer "Platformer") or [shoot 'em ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up "Shoot 'em up"), though still retain elements of procedural generation in how gameplay maps and levels are generated to assure that the player has a means to complete each level along with permadeath. This also extends to [power-ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-up "Power-up") and other items that populate the game's map, selected by the game through procedural generational rules to assure the game feels fair to the player so they feel they have the [agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(psychology) "Agency (psychology)") to win the game.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-12)

Procedural generation is often used in [loot systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_system "Loot system") of quest-driven games, such as [action role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game "Action role-playing game") and [massive multiplayer online role playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_multiplayer_online_role_playing_game "Massive multiplayer online role playing game"). Though quests may feature fixed rewards, other loot, such as weapons and armor, may be generated for the player based on the player-character's level, the quest's level, their performance in the quest, and other random factors. This often leads to loot having a rarity quality applied to reflect when the procedural generation system has produced an item with better-than-average attributes. For example, the _[Borderlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands\_(series) "Borderlands (series)")_ series is based on its procedural generation system which can create over a million unique guns and other equipment.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-13) Many [open world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world "Open world") or [survival games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_game "Survival game") procedurally create a game world from a random seed or one provided by the player, so that each playthrough is different. These generation systems create numerous [pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel "Pixel")- or [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel "Voxel")-based [biomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome "Biome") with distribution of resources, objects, and creatures. The player frequently has the ability to adjust some of the generation parameters, such as specifying the amount of water coverage in a world. Examples of such games include _[Dwarf Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf\_Fortress "Dwarf Fortress")_, _[Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft "Minecraft"), and [Vintage Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vintage\_Story "Vintage Story")._

Procedural generation is also used in space exploration and trading games. _[Elite: Dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite:\_Dangerous "Elite: Dangerous")_, through using the 400 billion known stars of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") Galaxy as its world basis, uses procedural generation to simulate the planets in these solar systems. Similarly, _[Star Citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Citizen "Star Citizen")_ uses the technology to create seamlessly loaded planets among its hand-crafted universe. _[Outerra Anteworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outerra\_Anteworld "Outerra Anteworld")_ is a video game in development that uses procedural generation and real world data to create a virtual replica of planet Earth in true scale.

_[No Man's Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\_Man%27s\_Sky "No Man's Sky")_, by using procedural generation, is the largest video game in history, featuring a universe of 18 [quintillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintillion "Quintillion") planets across entire galaxies, which can be explored in flight or on foot. The planets all have their own uniquely diverse terrain, weather, flora, and fauna, as well as a number of space-faring alien species. The same content exists at the same places for all players (thanks to a single [random seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed "Random seed") number to their deterministic engine), which enables players to meet and share discoveries.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-new_yorker-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-16)

As in video games, procedural generation is often used in film to create visually interesting and accurate spaces rapidly. This comes in a wide variety of applications.

One application is _imperfect factories_, which are used by artists to rapidly generate many similar objects. This accounts for the fact that, in real life, no two objects are ever exactly alike. For instance, an artist can model a product for a grocery store, and then create an imperfect factory to generate many imperfect copies to populate a whole shelf.

[MASSIVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASSIVE_(software) "MASSIVE (software)") is a high-end computer animation and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") software package used for generating crowd-related visual effects for film and television. It was developed to create fighting armies of hundreds of thousands of soldiers for [Peter Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson "Peter Jackson")'s _[The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Lord\_of\_the\_Rings\_(film\_series) "The Lord of the Rings (film series)")_ films automatically.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-17)

Coherent noise can be extremely important to procedural workflow in film. [Simplex noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise "Simplex noise") is often faster with fewer artifacts, though an older function called [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise "Perlin noise") may be used as well. Coherent noise, in this case, refers to a function that generates smooth pseudo-randomness in n dimensions.

Poyck studied how procedurally generated cityscapes can be used to aid social simulations and to train self-driving cars.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-:2-18)

Procedural generation plays a pivotal part in the progression of [digital twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin "Digital twin"), which are very detailed virtual replicas of real-world objects used for simulation, analysis, and planning.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning) "Neural network (machine learning)") have recently been employed to refine procedurally generated content. Combining classic randomization methods with [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning "Deep learning") provides new ways for generating audio, images, 3D objects, and other content types. This is especially useful in game level development; [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning "Reinforcement learning") allows the development of agents that play generated levels, serving as automatic content evaluators.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-:02-19)

Integrating procedural generation with deep learning alters the landscape of digital content creation. Zakaria et al. demonstrated that different deep learning methods for procedurally generating [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban "Sokoban") levels have different strengths and weaknesses.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-:12-20)

Looking ahead, researchers are investigating methods to combine large language models (LLMs) with deep-learning powered procedural generation systems, aiming to enhance their adaptability. Zakaria suggests that "LLMs combined with reinforcement learning can create procedural assets that evolve dynamically based on real-time feedback".[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-:12-20) Zakaria investigated the application of advanced deep learning structures such as bootstrapped [LSTM (Long short-term memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory "Long short-term memory") generators and [GANs (Generative adversarial networks)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network "Generative adversarial network") to upgrade procedural level design. They found that "diversity sampling consistently increases the numbers of generated solutions and signatures", showing that hybrid approaches help overcome problems like repetitive patterns or lack of variation.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#cite_note-:12-20)
