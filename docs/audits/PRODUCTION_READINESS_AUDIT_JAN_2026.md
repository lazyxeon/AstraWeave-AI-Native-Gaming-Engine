- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Uncommented all modules (agent, coordination, world_events, narrative_coherence)
  - Fixed ConversationHistory::new() to use ContextConfig instead of usize
  - Fixed async fn recursion with Box::pin pattern
  - Added missing Agent trait methods (add_task, is_available)
  - Fixed CoordinationMetrics Clone derive
  - Fixed render_map HashMap<String, Value> → HashMap<String, String> conversion
  - Updated rand API (thread_rng → rng, gen → random)
  - Added rand dependency to Cargo.toml
- **Impact**: Full coordination system now compiles and tests pass

#### MINOR: Doctest Failures in astraweave-ai
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Location**: core_loop.rs (line 73), orchestrator.rs (line 210)

- **Resolution**: Updated doctests to use correct EnemyState fields

#### INFORMATIONAL: Stress Test Assertions
- **Status**: ⚠️ Timing-dependent (non-blocking)
- **Location**: perception_tests.rs
- **Impact**: None - these test performance characteristics, not correctness
- **Note**: May fail under system load, not a production blocker
