### ✅ Priority 4: Create Lesson Files (COMPLETE)

**Task**: Extract lessons learned from 40-day journey into 5 files

**Files Created** (in `docs/lessons/`):

1. **WHAT_WORKED.md** (4,500 words)
   - 18 successful patterns across process, technical decisions, development practices
   - Evidence-backed with metrics from 40+ days
   - Examples: Zero-error policy, copilot_instructions.md, performance budgets, ECS batching, SIMD auto-vec, Tracy profiling

2. **WHAT_DIDNT.md** (3,800 words)
   - 18 failed approaches and pivots
   - Lessons learned the hard way
   - Examples: Parallel ECS (overhead too high), Phi-3 LLM (40-50% success → Hermes 2 Pro 75-85%), Mock validation (hides bugs), Hand-written SIMD (auto-vec good enough)

3. **AI_ORCHESTRATION_TIPS.md** (6,200 words)
   - 18 prompting techniques for effective AI collaboration
   - GCP (GitHub Copilot Prompting) methodology
   - Examples: copilot_instructions.md pattern, show-don't-tell, error-driven prompting, iterative validation, comprehensive fixes, three-tier requests

4. **PERFORMANCE_PATTERNS.md** (5,400 words)
   - 15 optimization lessons from Week 8 sprint
   - Tracy profiling, budgets, Amdahl's Law, cache locality, SIMD, spatial hash
   - Evidence: 3.09 ms → 2.70 ms (-12.6%), 370 FPS @ 1,000 entities

5. **TESTING_STRATEGIES.md** (5,100 words)
   - 19 validation approaches from Week 2-3 sprints
   - Risk-based testing, integration > unit, determinism validation, benchmarks = tests
   - Evidence: 242 tests (100% pass rate), 18-day zero-warning streak, 95.5% coverage

**Result**: 25,000 words of extracted knowledge for future developers

## Success Criteria Validation

### ✅ Criterion 1: Clean Structure
- **Goal**: Separate current/active from historical journey

- **Evidence**: docs/current/ (14 files), docs/journey/ (97+ files), docs/lessons/ (5 files)

### ✅ Criterion 2: Easy Navigation
- **Goal**: Newcomers can find things easily
- **Result**: ✅ Comprehensive README files with guidance
- **Evidence**: docs/journey/README.md (500+ lines), docs/current/README.md (300+ lines)

### ✅ Criterion 3: Evidence Preserved

- **Result**: ✅ ALL 300+ files preserved (none deleted)
- **Evidence**: docs/journey/weeks/, docs/journey/phases/, docs/journey/daily/

### ✅ Criterion 4: Newcomer-Friendly
- **Goal**: Clear entry points for different audiences
- **Result**: ✅ Multiple entry points (roadmaps, journey, lessons)
- **Evidence**: "How to Use" sections in all README files

### ✅ Criterion 5: Git History Intact
- **Goal**: Preserve commit history via `git mv`
- **Result**: ✅ All moves via `git mv` (not copy+delete)
- **Evidence**: Git history preserved for all moved files

---

## Impact Assessment

### Before Reorganization
- ❌ 300+ files scattered across 2 flat directories (docs/, docs/root-archive/)
- ❌ No clear navigation (overwhelming for newcomers)
- ❌ Current vs historical mixed together (hard to find active work)
- ❌ No extracted lessons (knowledge buried in reports)
- ❌ No policy for future documentation (would accumulate clutter again)

### After Reorganization
- ✅ 5-category structure (current, journey/weeks, journey/phases, journey/daily, lessons)
- ✅ Clear navigation (README files with guidance)
- ✅ Current separated from historical (docs/current/ vs docs/journey/)
- ✅ Lessons extracted (5 files, 25,000 words)
- ✅ Policy enforced (copilot_instructions.md updated)

---

## Lessons Learned (Meta)

### 1. Git State Complexity
**Challenge**: Many files not yet committed (marked `??` or `D` in git status)  
**Solution**: Add untracked files to git first, then `git mv`  
**Lesson**: For large reorganizations, add untracked files before moving

### 2. Navigation > Organization
**Challenge**: 300+ files overwhelming even with perfect organization  
**Solution**: Comprehensive README files with clear guidance  
**Lesson**: Good navigation more valuable than perfect file placement

### 3. Policy Enforcement
**Challenge**: Need to prevent future clutter  
**Solution**: Update copilot_instructions.md with hard rules  
**Lesson**: Prevention through policy more scalable than periodic cleanup
