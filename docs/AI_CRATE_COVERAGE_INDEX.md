## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Where do I start?

**A:** Read documents in this order:
1. `TASK_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` (5 min) - Quick overview
2. `AI_CRATE_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` (15 min) - Current state
3. `AI_CRATE_STRATEGIC_ROADMAP.md` (20 min) - Strategic context
4. `AI_CRATE_80_PERCENT_FOLLOWUP_PLAN.md` (30 min) - Implementation details

**Total:** ~70 minutes to full understanding

---

### Q2: What's the fastest path to 80%+ coverage?

**A:** Follow the 3-phase plan:
- **Week 1:** Phase 1 (async_task + ai_arbiter) → 31.7% coverage
- **Week 2:** Phase 2 (LLM modules) → 39.0% coverage
- **Week 3:** Phase 3 (core/nav/physics) → 49.5% coverage
- **Months 2-6:** Integration tests, edge cases, LLM testing → 75-85% coverage

**Critical Path:** Phase 1 (async infrastructure) is highest priority.

---

### Q3: Can I skip any phases?

**A:** Yes, phases are independent:
- **Phase 1:** 🔥 REQUIRED (blocks production, highest impact)
- **Phase 2:** 🟡 RECOMMENDED (CI reliability, external service mocking)
- **Phase 3:** 🟢 OPTIONAL (polish, nice-to-have, can defer)

**Minimum Viable:** Phase 1 alone gets to 31.7% with 80%+ critical module coverage.

---

### Q4: How do I track progress?

**A:** Use these checkpoints:

**After Each Phase:**
```powershell
# Generate HTML report
cargo tarpaulin -p astraweave-ai --lib --out Html --output-dir coverage_reports

# Check overall coverage
cargo tarpaulin -p astraweave-ai --lib --out Stdout | grep "coverage"

# Verify test count
cargo test -p astraweave-ai -- --list | wc -l
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Phase 1: async_task 80%+, ai_arbiter 80%+, 60+ tests
- Phase 2: LLM modules 60%+, cache 100%, 75+ tests
- Phase 3: Overall 45%+, no module <20%, 90+ tests

---

### Q5: What if I encounter problems?

**A:** Refer to risk mitigation strategies:

**Async Test Flakiness (🔴 HIGH):**
- Use `tokio::time::pause()` for deterministic timing
- Run with `--test-threads=1`
- Add explicit timeouts
- Document timing assumptions

**Mock Server Complexity (🟡 MEDIUM):**
- Use established libraries (mockito, wiremock)
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Test mock server separately first

**Coverage Tool Limitations (🟡 MEDIUM):**
- Cross-validate with manual review
- Use `#[coverage(off)]` for unreachable code
- Alternative: cargo-llvm-cov

**Time Overrun (🟢 LOW):**
- Pause after Phase 1 (8.4% gain)
- Skip Phase 3 (optional polish)
- Extend timeline if needed

---

### Q6: How do I add new tests?

**A:** Follow the templates in `AI_CRATE_80_PERCENT_FOLLOWUP_PLAN.md`:

**For AsyncTask:**
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_async_task_completes_successfully() {
    let task = AsyncTask::new(async { Ok(42) });
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10)).await;
    
    let result = task.try_recv();
    assert!(result.is_some());
    assert_eq!(result.unwrap().unwrap(), 42);
}
```

**For AIArbiter:**
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_arbiter_transitions_to_executing_llm() {
    let (mut arbiter, _) = create_test_arbiter();
    let plan = create_test_plan(3);
    
    arbiter.transition_to_llm(plan);
    
    assert_eq!(arbiter.mode(), AIControlMode::ExecutingLLM { step_index: 0 });
}
```

See follow-up plan for 30+ more examples.
