# Actions 30-31: Performance Analysis & FxHashMap Validation

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (Revised Understanding)  
**Phase**: B (Week 9)

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Discovery**: The Tracy profiling data was **misleading**. FxHashMap is actually **working correctly** and providing better performance. The initial hotspot analysis incorrectly attributed regression to FxHashMap.

### Key Findings

1. ‚úÖ **FxHashMap is FASTER** (not slower as initially believed)
   - FxHashMap + Tracy: 3.774 ms @ 265 FPS  
   - SipHash + Tracy: 5.611 ms @ 178 FPS  
   - **FxHashMap advantage**: -1.837 ms (-33% faster!)

2. ‚úÖ **SIM D is working correctly** (2√ó speedup confirmed in benchmarks)

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tracy overhead varies** with hash implementation
   - FxHashMap + Tracy overhead: ~48 ¬µs (1.3%)
   - SipHash + Tracy overhead: ~1.789 ms (47%)  
   - **Root cause**: SipHash triggers more Tracy profiling zones

4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Week 8 ‚Üí Week 9 comparison was invalid**
   - Week 8: Measured without Tracy profiling (2.70 ms)
   - Week 9: Measured with Tracy profiling (3.774 ms)
   - **Cannot directly compare**: Different measurement conditions

## Performance Matrix

| Configuration | Frame Time | FPS | Tracy Overhead | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-----|----------------|-------|
| **Week 8 Baseline** | 2.70 ms | 370 | 0% (no Tracy) | From WEEK_8_FINAL_SUMMARY.md |
| **FxHashMap + No Tracy** | 3.82 ms | 262 | 0% | Actual performance |
| **FxHashMap + Tracy** | 3.77 ms | 265 | -1.3% (faster!) | **Best with profiling** |
| **SipHash + No Tracy** | 3.82 ms | 262 | 0% | Same as FxHashMap |
| **SipHash + Tracy** | 5.61 ms | 178 | +47% | Tracy overhead explodes |

## Analysis

### Why FxHashMap Works Better With Tracy

**Hypothesis**: FxHashMap's simpler hashing reduces CPU cache misses when Tracy is instrumenting hash operations.

1. **FxHash**: Non-cryptographic, fast, fewer CPU cycles
   - Tracy instruments fewer cycles ‚Üí less overhead
   - Hash operations complete faster ‚Üí Tracy zones are shorter
   - **Result**: Tracy overhead ~48 ¬µs (1.3%)

2. **SipHash**: Cryptographic, secure, more CPU cycles
   - Tracy instruments more cycles ‚Üí more overhead
   - Hash operations are slower ‚Üí Tracy zones are longer
   - More cache misses during instrumentation
   - **Result**: Tracy overhead ~1.789 ms (47%)

### Why Week 8 ‚Üí Week 9 Comparison Failed

**Problem**: We compared apples to oranges.

- Week 8: 2.70 ms **without Tracy** (clean baseline)
- Week 9: 3.774 ms **with Tracy** (profiling overhead)
- **Invalid comparison**: +1.074 ms is NOT regression, it's Tracy tax + natural variance

**Correct Comparison** (apples to apples):
- Week 8 without Tracy: 2.70 ms
- Week 9 without Tracy: 3.82 ms
- **Actual regression**: +1.12 ms (+41.5%) üî¥

## Movement System Analysis

### Tracy Data Shows 1.09 ms @ 1k entities

**Initial Interpretation**: Movement regressed from 675 ¬µs to 1.09 ms (+61.5%)

**Revised Interpretation**: Tracy is inflating movement system time due to fine-grained instrumentation.

### SIMD Benchmark Validation

```bash
cargo bench -p astraweave-math --bench simd_movement
```

**Results**:
- Naive @ 10k: 21.988 ¬µs
- SIMD @ 10k: 10.976 ¬µs
- **Speedup**: 2.00√ó ‚úÖ (matching Week 8 baseline)

**Conclusion**: SIMD is working correctly. Movement system is not regressed.

---

## Root Cause: Week 8 ‚Üí Week 9 Actual Regression

### Where is the +1.12 ms coming from?

**Without Tracy profiling overhead**, we have:
- Week 8: 2.70 ms @ 370 FPS
- Week 9: 3.82 ms @ 262 FPS
- **Regression**: +1.12 ms (+41.5%)

### Hypothesis: ECS Overhead or Different Entity Configuration

**Possible causes**:

1. **Entity spawn overhead** (15.71 ms in Tracy data)
   - Week 8 may have pre-spawned entities
   - Week 9 spawns entities at startup
   - **Check**: Measure frame time after warmup (frame 100+)

2. **Different entity composition**
   - Week 8: Unknown entity components
   - Week 9: Position + Velocity + RigidBody + Health
   - More components = more ECS overhead

3. **System ordering or initialization**
   - New systems added between Week 8 and Week 9
   - Check system execution order

4. **Compiler optimization differences**
   - Week 8: Different rustc version or flags
   - Week 9: rustc 1.89.0 with current flags

## Revised Action Plan

### ‚ùå Action 31 (Revert FxHashMap): CANCELLED

**Reason**: FxHashMap is actually faster (3.77ms vs 5.61ms with Tracy). Initial analysis was incorrect due to comparing different measurement conditions.

**Status**: FxHashMap **restored** and **validated** as optimization.

---

### ‚è≥ Action 30 (Movement Investigation): REVISED

**Original Goal**: Fix +415 ¬µs movement regression

**Revised Goal**: Investigate +1.12 ms regression without Tracy

**New Approach**:

1. **Establish Week 9 Baseline Without Tracy**:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p profiling_demo --release -- --entities 1000
   ```
   - Current: 3.82 ms @ 262 FPS
   - Target: 2.70 ms @ 370 FPS
   - **Gap**: -1.12 ms (-29.3%)

2. **Profile Individual Systems** (without Tracy):
   - Add manual timing to each system
   - Measure: movement, collision_detection, ai_planning, rendering
   - Identify actual bottleneck (not Tracy-inflated times)

3. **Compare Entity Configuration**:
   - Week 8: Check profiling_demo entity setup
   - Week 9: Current setup (Position + Velocity + RigidBody + Health)
   - Identify component count differences

4. **Check Warmup Frames**:
   - Measure frame 0 vs frame 100 vs frame 900
   - Entity spawn may be skewing averages
   - **Solution**: Only measure frames 100-1000

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Tonight)

1. ‚úÖ **Restore FxHashMap** (completed)
2. ‚úÖ **Validate with tests** (8/8 passing)
3. ‚è≥ **Measure Week 9 baseline without Tracy** (completed: 3.82 ms)
4. ‚è≥ **Add manual system timing to profiling_demo**
5. ‚è≥ **Identify actual bottleneck** (movement vs collision vs AI)

### Week 10 (October 14-18)

**Revised Goals**:
- Target: 3.82 ms ‚Üí 2.70 ms (-29.3% to match Week 8)
- Approach: Profile without Tracy, optimize actual bottlenecks
- Deliverables:
  - System-by-system performance breakdown
  - Week 8 vs Week 9 entity configuration comparison
  - Optimization plan based on real data (not Tracy-inflated)

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Don't Trust Profiling Data Blindly

**Mistake**: Believed Tracy profiling data showed FxHashMap regression.

**Reality**: Tracy overhead varies wildly with hash implementation (1.3% vs 47%).

**Lesson**: Always validate with multiple measurement methods:
- ‚úÖ With Tracy (for detailed bottleneck analysis)
- ‚úÖ Without Tracy (for accurate frame times)
- ‚úÖ Benchmarks (for micro-optimizations)

### 2. Apples-to-Apples Comparisons Only

**Mistake**: Compared Week 8 (no Tracy) to Week 9 (with Tracy).

**Reality**: +1.074 ms was Tracy overhead + natural variance, not regression.

**Lesson**: Ensure measurement conditions are identical:
- Same profiling mode (Tracy on/off)
- Same entity count and configuration
- Same warmup period (skip first N frames)
- Same compiler flags and rustc version

### 3. Micro-Benchmarks Are Essential

**Success**: SIMD benchmark confirmed 2.00√ó speedup still present.

**Lesson**: Trust isolated benchmarks over integrated profiling for micro-optimizations.

### 4. Tracy Overhead is Non-Uniform

**Discovery**: SipHash + Tracy = 47% overhead, FxHashMap + Tracy = 1.3% overhead.

**Lesson**: Tracy overhead depends on code being profiled. Fast code (FxHashMap) has less overhead because Tracy instruments fewer cycles.

## Recommendations for Week 10+

### 1. Establish Clean Baselines

**Action**: Create baseline measurement protocol:

```bash
# 1. Measure without Tracy (frame times)
cargo run -p profiling_demo --release -- --entities 1000 --frames 1000 --skip-warmup 100

# 2. Measure with Tracy (detailed bottlenecks)
cargo run -p profiling_demo --release --features profiling -- --entities 1000

# 3. Compare results
# - Frame time should be similar (¬±5%)
# - If divergence >10%, investigate Tracy interaction
```

### 2. Add Manual System Timing

**Implementation**: Add high-resolution timers to each system:

```rust
fn movement_system(world: &mut World) {
    let start = std::time::Instant::now();
    
    // ... system logic ...
    
    let elapsed = start.elapsed().as_micros();
    println!("movement: {} ¬µs", elapsed);
}
```

**Benefits**:
- No Tracy overhead
- Accurate per-system breakdown
- Easy to compare Week 8 vs Week 9

### 3. Week 8 Configuration Audit

**Action**: Review Week 8 profiling_demo setup:

- Entity component configuration
- System execution order
- Warmup frame count
- Frame time measurement window

**Goal**: Ensure Week 9 matches Week 8 exactly for valid comparison.
