# AstraWeave Game Engine Readiness Roadmap

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Phase 7 Complete, Planning Next Steps  
**Objective**: Transform AstraWeave from "production-ready infrastructure" to "ship a game on it"

---

## Executive Summary

AstraWeave has achieved remarkable technical milestones‚Äîa production-validated AI-native game engine with 12,700+ agent capacity, 100% deterministic simulation, and comprehensive tooling. **However, significant gaps remain before a game developer can create and ship a complete game.**

This roadmap identifies **8 critical gaps** organized into 3 phases over **6-12 months**, taking AstraWeave from its current state (excellent infrastructure, excellent AI, good authoring tools) to **"ship a game with zero external dependencies"**.

### Current State (January 2025)

**‚úÖ Production-Ready**:
- AI-native architecture (Perception ‚Üí Reasoning ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Action)
- 12,700+ agents @ 60 FPS (validated)
- Deterministic ECS with 100% replay accuracy
- Real Phi-3 LLM integration (40-50% success rate)
- 37-tool vocabulary for AI planning
- Tracy profiling, SIMD optimization, spatial hash collision
- GPU skinning, mesh optimization, PBR rendering pipeline
- Editor with 14 panels (BT/Dialogue/Quest graphs, terrain painter, material editor)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Missing for "Ship a Game"**:
- **No complete rendering pipeline** (skybox, post-processing, shadows, lighting)
- **No production audio system** (3D spatial audio exists but needs integration)
- **No UI framework** for in-game menus/HUD
- **No save/load system** for player progress
- **No packaged build pipeline** for distribution
- **No networking** for multiplayer
- **No performance profiling in production** (Tracy is dev-only)
- **Limited asset pipeline** (no texture atlasing, no animation retargeting)

### Transformation Goal

**From**: "Excellent game engine infrastructure with AI focus"  
**To**: "Fully capable game engine where a developer can create, test, and ship a complete game"

## Gap Analysis: 8 Critical Missing Features

### 1. Complete Rendering Pipeline üé® **CRITICAL**

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ PBR materials with IBL
- ‚úÖ BC7/BC5 texture compression
- ‚úÖ GPU skinning

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **Rendering Pipeline Complexity**
   - Risk: Shadow mapping + GI can take 8+ weeks alone
   - Mitigation: Start with CSM only, defer GI to Phase 10
   - Fallback: Use existing Unity/Unreal tutorials for reference

2. **UI Framework Choice**
   - Risk: Wrong choice locks in for years
   - Mitigation: Prototype with egui first (quick), evaluate later
   - Fallback: Custom immediate-mode UI (more work but full control)

3. **Networking is Massive**
   - Risk: Can easily consume 6+ months
   - Mitigation: Make Phase 10 entirely optional
   - Fallback: Partner with networking specialists or license middleware

### Medium Risk

4. **Asset Pipeline Fragmentation**
   - Risk: Many moving parts (atlasing, retargeting, LOD, hot-reload)
   - Mitigation: Implement incrementally, test each feature
   - Fallback: Manual asset optimization (slower but works)

5. **Platform SDK Integration**
   - Risk: Steamworks, Epic, itch.io APIs change frequently
   - Mitigation: Use community-maintained bindings (e.g., `steamworks-rs`)
   - Fallback: Basic builds without platform features

### Low Risk

6. **Save/Load Corruption**
   - Risk: Save corruption destroys player progress
   - Mitigation: Checksums, versioning, auto-backup
   - Fallback: Players can always start new save

7. **Profiling Overhead**
   - Risk: Production profiler slows down game
   - Mitigation: Make telemetry opt-in, use sampling
   - Fallback: Disable profiling in final builds

---

## Alternative Approach: Partner with Existing Engines

**If timeline is too aggressive**, consider:

1. **Focus on AI-Native Features Only**
   - Partner with Unity/Unreal for rendering/UI/audio
   - Export AstraWeave AI system as plugin
   - Faster to market (3-6 months vs 12 months)

2. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Use AstraWeave for AI + simulation
   - Use Godot/Bevy for rendering + UI
   - Bridge via FFI (C API already exists)

3. **Community-Driven Development**
   - Open-source missing features
   - Accept contributions for rendering/networking
   - Slower but sustainable

---

## Conclusion

**AstraWeave is 60-70% complete** for shipping a full game:

‚úÖ **Excellent**: AI-native architecture, deterministic ECS, performance validation  
‚úÖ **Good**: Authoring tools, GPU rendering basics, asset pipeline  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Work**: Complete rendering, in-game UI, save/load, audio mixer  
‚ùå **Missing**: Build pipeline, networking (optional)

**Recommended Path**:
1. **Commit to Phase 8** (3-4.5 months) - Core game loop essentials
2. **Evaluate market fit** - Does demo resonate?
3. **Proceed to Phase 9** (2-2.75 months) - Distribution readiness
4. **Defer Phase 10** unless multiplayer is critical

**Total to "Ship a Single-Player Game"**: **6-7 months** (Phases 8 + 9)

---

**Next Action**: Approve Phase 8 roadmap and begin **Shadow Mapping** implementation (Week 1-2)
