## Special Instructions

1. **Focus on AI-Native Aspects First** - The AI loop is AstraWeave's differentiator
2. **Verify Performance Claims** - 676 characters @ 60 FPS, 10M polygons, etc.
3. **Check Determinism Rigorously** - Any non-determinism is critical
4. **Don't Assume Placeholders** - If code looks incomplete, flag it
5. **Security Review** - Can AI agents cheat? Can clients exploit validation?
6. **Cross-Reference Documentation** - Do claims in README match code reality?

---

## Begin Analysis

Start with:
1. `astraweave-ai/` - AI orchestration and planning
2. `astraweave-core/` - ECS and validation
3. `astraweave-physics/` - Deterministic simulation
4. `astraweave-render/` - Rendering pipeline claims
5. `examples/hello_companion/` - Why does it panic?

Then proceed through remaining crates systematically.
