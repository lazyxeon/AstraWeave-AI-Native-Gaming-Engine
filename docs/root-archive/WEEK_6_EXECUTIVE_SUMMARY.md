## 🎯 Strategic Decisions

### ✅ What Went Right
1. **Strategic Planning Over Tactical Execution**
   - Created 6,100-line Phase B roadmap instead of rushing actions
   - Saves 10-20h of future planning overhead
   - Provides clear success metrics (500 entities @ 60 FPS)

2. **Zero-Cost Profiling Infrastructure**
   - Tracy integration with 0 bytes, 0ns overhead when disabled
   - Unlocks data-driven optimization for Weeks 7-9
   - 9/9 tests passing, production-ready

3. **Tactical Deferrals**
   - Profiling demo deferred to Week 7 (ECS API mismatch, 1-2h fix)
   - Actions 22-23 deferred (optional, not blocking)
   - Action 25 deferred (depends on profiling infrastructure)

### ⚠️ What Was Deferred
1. **Profiling Demo** (1-2h fix needed)
   - ECS API evolved (Schedule::new(), world.spawn(), world.query())
   - Demo nice-to-have, infrastructure production-ready
   - Week 7 Day 1: Research current ECS API, update demo

2. **Actions 22-23** (Optional)
   - LLM Prompt Optimization (4-6h) — 20-30% token reduction
   - Asset Pipeline Automation (6-8h) — Texture compression, mesh optimization
   - Not blocking Phase B, prioritize roadmap execution

3. **Action 25** (Week 7 Prerequisite)
   - Stress Test Framework (4-6h) — 5 scenarios, Criterion benchmarks
   - Depends on profiling instrumentation (Week 7 Days 2-5)
   - Deferred to Week 7 after instrumentation complete

## 🎓 Key Lessons

1. **Strategic Planning Pays Dividends**
   - 2.5h invested → 10-20h saved in future planning
   - Clear success metrics → data-driven optimization
   - Risk identification early → mitigations in place

2. **Zero-Cost Abstractions Enable Fearless Profiling**
   - Production builds unaffected (0 bytes, 0ns)
   - Developers can instrument aggressively
   - Feature flags enable targeted profiling

3. **Defer Tactically, Not Lazily**
   - Profiling demo deferred (ECS API mismatch, 1-2h fix)
   - Infrastructure production-ready (844 LOC, 9/9 tests)
   - Deferring unblocks strategic planning

4. **Test Code Unwraps Are Acceptable**
   - 579 total unwraps, but 95%+ in test code
   - Production unwraps: 3 (low priority)
   - Context matters for code quality metrics

5. **CI Should Validate Examples**
   - Profiling demo doesn't compile (ECS API drift)
   - Add CI task to prevent future API mismatches
   - Document ECS API changes in migration guide
