**Why Nice-to-Have:**
- Not on critical path
- Covered by integration tests
- Lower risk of bugs
- Can defer to future iterations

**Target:** 40-50% coverage

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Async Infrastructure (Week 1) 🔥

**Goal:** Test all async operations for production readiness

**Timeline:** 4-5 hours over 3 days

**Tasks:**

#### 1.1 AsyncTask Testing (1.5 hours)
- **File:** `astraweave-ai/tests/async_task_tests.rs` (new)

- ✅ `blocking_recv()` waits until completion
- ✅ `abort()` cancels long-running tasks
- ✅ `is_finished()` status reflects task state
- ✅ Panics are caught and returned as errors
- ✅ Multiple calls to `try_recv()` handle consumed state

**Expected Outcome:**
- +40 lines covered (+1.8%)
- Zero async bugs in production
- Reliable LLM task management

---

#### 1.2 AIArbiter Integration (2.5 hours)
- **File:** `astraweave-ai/tests/arbiter_comprehensive_tests.rs` (extend)
- **Tests:** 12-15 integration tests
- **Coverage Target:** 160/200 lines (80%)

**Test Categories:**
1. Mode transitions (GOAP ↔ ExecutingLLM ↔ BT)
2. Plan execution (step advancement, completion)
3. Cooldown management (LLM request throttling)
4. Metrics tracking (transitions, actions, failures)
5. Error handling (invalid plans, LLM failures)
6. Concurrent update safety

**Key Validations:**
- ✅ Arbiter initializes in GOAP mode
- ✅ LLM requests triggered after cooldown
- ✅ Plan steps execute sequentially
- ✅ Returns to GOAP after plan exhaustion
- ✅ Handles empty/invalid plans gracefully
- ✅ Metrics increment correctly

5. Error propagation
6. Connection failures

**Mock Server Implementation:**
```rust
struct MockOllamaServer {
    port: u16,

    failure_count: AtomicUsize,
}

impl MockOllamaServer {
    fn new() -> Self { /* Start HTTP server */ }
    fn add_success_response(&mut self, endpoint: &str, json: &str) { /* ... */ }
    fn add_failure(&mut self, endpoint: &str, count: usize) { /* ... */ }
    fn add_delay(&mut self, endpoint: &str, duration: Duration) { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Key Validations:**
- ✅ Successful request returns valid JSON
- ✅ Retry attempts 3 times before failure
- ✅ Circuit breaker opens after 5 failures

**Contingency:** +25% (3.75h) for unexpected issues

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Async Test Flakiness 🔴 HIGH

**Probability:** 60%  
**Impact:** High (blocks CI, wastes time debugging)

**Mitigation:**
- Use `tokio::time::pause()` for deterministic timing
- Run with `--test-threads=1` by default
- Add explicit timeouts to all async tests
- Document timing assumptions clearly

**Contingency:**
- If flaky: Add retry logic (max 3 attempts)
- If persistent: Move to integration tests only

---

#### Risk 2: Mock Server Complexity 🟡 MEDIUM

**Probability:** 40%  
**Impact:** Medium (delays Phase 2)

**Mitigation:**
- Use established libraries (mockito, wiremock)
- Start simple (static responses)
- Add complexity gradually (delays, failures)
- Test mock server separately first

**Contingency:**
- If too complex: Use in-memory mocks instead
- If incomplete: Test against real Ollama (CI optional)

---

#### Risk 3: Coverage Tool Limitations 🟡 MEDIUM

**Probability:** 30%  
**Impact:** Medium (inaccurate metrics)

**Mitigation:**
- Tarpaulin has known issues with async code
- Cross-validate with manual review
- Use `#[coverage(off)]` for unreachable code
- Document known gaps

**Contingency:**
- If tarpaulin fails: Use cargo-llvm-cov
- If metrics off: Focus on critical paths only

---

#### Risk 4: Time Overrun 🟢 LOW

**Probability:** 50%  
**Impact:** Low (not critical path)

**Mitigation:**
- Phases are independent (can pause after Phase 1)
- Phase 1 alone is huge win (+8.4%)
- Phase 3 is optional polish
- Can extend timeline if needed

**Contingency:**
- If behind schedule: Skip Phase 3
- If blocked: Focus on critical modules only

---

### Organizational Risks

#### Risk 5: Changing Priorities 🟢 LOW

**Probability:** 20%  
**Impact:** Medium (coverage stalls)

**Mitigation:**
- Align with Phase 8 roadmap
- Coverage blocks Veilweaver deployment
- Small time investment (2-3 weeks)
- High ROI (production readiness)

**Contingency:**
- If priorities shift: Complete Phase 1 minimum
- If paused: Document progress in roadmap

---
