# Supplementary Documentation Archive

This directory centralizes historical reports, validation summaries, and supplementary guidance that previously lived at the repository root.  Content is organized into topical buckets to make discovery easier while keeping the root clean for build tooling and source code.

## Directory Layout

- `guidelines/` – community and security policies such as the contributing guide, code of conduct, and security policy.
- `images/` – visual references used by the supplementary reports.
- `run-logs/` – validation transcripts, build logs, and other textual run artifacts preserved for traceability.
- `*.md` – executive summaries, project milestone reports, technical deep dives, and other narrative documentation.

## Linking Conventions

Root-level references (including this repository's main README) now point to the relocated files using relative `docs/supplementary/...` paths.  Update any additional documentation you own to follow the same pattern when referencing these resources.
