# Action 14: Terrain Streaming Phase 2 - Strategic Assessment

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: 🔄 **INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS, OPTIMIZATION NEEDED**  
**Current State**: Soak test failing (9.37ms p99 vs 2.0ms target, 273K missing chunks)

---

## Situation Analysis

### ✅ What Exists (Already Implemented)

**Infrastructure Complete** (~1,000 LOC):
1. **background_loader.rs** (420 LOC): Priority-based async chunk loading, tokio task pool
2. **lod_manager.rs** (373 LOC): 4 LOD levels (L0-L3), hysteresis, blend zones
3. **lod_blending.rs** (exists): Cross-fade transitions
4. **streaming_diagnostics.rs** (exists): Metrics, hitch detection, memory tracking
5. **streaming_integrity.rs** (test suite): Soak test (1024 ticks), quick validation

**Test Results**:
```bash
✅ streaming_quick_validation ... ok (64 ticks)
❌ streaming_soak_test_1024_ticks ... FAILED
   - p99 frame time: 9.37ms (target: <2.0ms) → 369% over budget
   - Missing chunks: 273,894 (target: 0)
   - Memory delta: unknown (target: <6%)
```

### ❌ What's Broken

**Performance Issues**:
1. **p99 frame spikes**: 9.37ms (exceeds 2.0ms threshold by 369%)
2. **Missing chunks**: 273,894 chunks not loaded in view frustum
3. **Likely causes**:
   - Synchronous chunk generation blocking async loader
   - Inadequate prefetch strategy (camera movement prediction)
   - Priority queue not processing fast enough
   - Memory budget enforcement too aggressive (evicting visible chunks)

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
- Background loader exists but **chunk generation is synchronous** (blocks task pool)
- LOD manager exists but **transitions may be triggering excessive reloads**
- Diagnostics exist but **thresholds too strict for current implementation**

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Quick Win Plan (4-6 Hours)

**Goal**: Get soak test passing at **4ms p99** (relaxed from 2ms), zero missing chunks.

#### Phase 1: Diagnostic Deep Dive (1 hour)

```powershell
# Add detailed logging to understand bottleneck
# Modify streaming_integrity.rs to export per-frame telemetry

cargo test -p astraweave-terrain --test streaming_integrity streaming_soak_test_1024_ticks -- --nocapture > soak_detailed.log

# Analyze:
# - Which frames spike >9ms?
# - What operation causes spike? (generation, LOD switch, eviction)
# - Is task pool saturated?
```

**Expected Findings**:
- Chunk generation dominates frame time (synchronous mesh building)
- Priority queue processes only 1-2 chunks/frame (too slow)
- LOD transitions trigger chunk reloads (should reuse existing mesh)

#### Phase 2: Quick Fixes (2-3 hours)

**Fix 1: Async Chunk Generation** (1.5 hours)
- Move mesh building to tokio task (currently sync)
- Only submit mesh to GPU on main thread
- **Expected Impact**: p99 drops to 3-4ms

**Fix 2: Increase Concurrent Loads** (30 min)
- Change `max_concurrent_loads: 4` → `8` in `StreamingConfig`
- Add adaptive throttling (reduce load if frame time >10ms)
- **Expected Impact**: Missing chunks → 0

**Fix 3: LOD Mesh Caching** (1 hour)
- Cache LOD meshes instead of regenerating on transition
- Store 3 LOD levels per chunk (L0, L1, L2)
- **Expected Impact**: Eliminates LOD transition spikes

#### Phase 3: Validation (1 hour)

```powershell
# Re-run soak test with fixes
cargo test -p astraweave-terrain --test streaming_integrity streaming_soak_test_1024_ticks -- --nocapture

# Expected:
# ✅ p99 frame time: 3.5-4.0ms (under relaxed 4ms target)
# ✅ Missing chunks: 0
# ✅ Memory delta: <6%
# ✅ Hitch count: <10
```

### Full Optimization Plan (10-14 Hours) - Defer to Week 5?

**Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations** (Week 5 candidate):
- Prefetch prediction (load N chunks ahead based on camera velocity)
- Chunk pooling (reuse allocated buffers)
- SIMD mesh generation (AVX2 optimize marching cubes)
- GPU mesh building (compute shaders for LOD generation)

**Justification for Defer**:
- Quick fixes get soak test passing (acceptance criteria met)
- Advanced optimizations yield diminishing returns (4ms → 2ms = 50% but complex)
- Week 4 has 3 more actions (15, 16, plus final report)
- Better to complete Week 4 with working streaming, optimize in Week 5

---

## Recommendation

### Option A: Quick Fix (4-6 hours) ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Scope**: Get soak test passing with relaxed threshold (4ms p99)
- Fix async generation
- Increase concurrent loads
- Add LOD mesh caching
- Validate soak test passes

**Outcome**: Action 14 acceptance criteria met (with adjusted threshold)

**Week 4 Completion**: 
- Action 14: 4-6 hours (quick fix)
- Action 15: 6-8 hours (benchmark dashboard)
- Action 16: 4-6 hours (unwrap remediation)
- **Total**: 14-20 hours remaining
- **Timeline**: Complete by October 15-16

### Option B: Full Optimization (10-14 hours) ⚠️ RISKY

**Scope**: Hit original 2ms p99 target with advanced optimizations

**Risk**: May delay Week 4 completion to October 17-18

**Recommendation**: Defer to Week 5 (Phase B Month 1)

---

## Decision Required

**Question**: Should we:
1. **Quick fix** (4-6 hours) → relaxed 4ms threshold → proceed to Actions 15-16?
2. **Full optimization** (10-14 hours) → original 2ms target → risk delay?

**My Recommendation**: **Option 1** (Quick Fix)

**Rationale**:
- Streaming works, just needs performance tuning
- 4ms p99 still within 60 FPS budget (16.67ms)
- Week 4 momentum important (50% complete, finish strong)
- Advanced optimizations better suited for dedicated Week 5 sprint

---

## Next Steps (Pending Decision)

### If Quick Fix Approved:

1. **Diagnostic Analysis** (1 hour):
   - Add frame telemetry to soak test
   - Identify bottleneck operations
   - Create optimization plan

2. **Implement Fixes** (2-3 hours):
   - Async chunk generation
   - Concurrent load increase
   - LOD mesh caching

3. **Validation** (1 hour):
   - Run soak test
   - Verify <4ms p99, 0 missing chunks
   - Update thresholds in test

4. **Documentation** (1 hour):
   - Create WEEK_4_ACTION_14_COMPLETE.md
   - Update WEEK_4_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md
   - Note Week 5 optimization plan

**Total**: 4-6 hours → October 13 evening completion

### If Full Optimization Approved:

- Proceed with 10-14 hour plan from WEEK_4_KICKOFF.md
- Accept October 17-18 Week 4 completion date
- Risk: May compress Actions 15-16
