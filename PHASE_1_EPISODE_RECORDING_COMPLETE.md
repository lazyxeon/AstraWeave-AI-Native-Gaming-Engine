## Implementation Details

### Files Created

**Core Episode Types** (`astraweave-memory/src/episode.rs` - 550 LOC)
```rust
pub enum EpisodeCategory {
    Combat, Dialogue, Exploration, Puzzle, Quest, Social
}

pub struct Episode {
    pub id: String,
    pub category: EpisodeCategory,
    pub start_time: SystemTime,
    pub end_time: Option<SystemTime>,
    pub observations: Vec<Observation>,
    pub outcome: Option<EpisodeOutcome>,
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
}

pub struct Observation {
    pub timestamp_ms: u64,
    pub player_action: Option<PlayerAction>,
    pub companion_response: Option<CompanionResponse>,
    pub world_state: serde_json::Value,
}

pub struct EpisodeOutcome {
    pub success_rating: f32,          // 0.0 - 1.0
    pub player_satisfaction: f32,     // 0.0 - 1.0
    pub companion_effectiveness: f32, // 0.0 - 1.0
    pub duration_ms: u64,
    pub damage_dealt: f32,
    pub damage_taken: f32,
    pub resources_used: f32,
    pub failure_count: u32,
}
```

**Key Features:**
- `EpisodeOutcome::quality_score()` - Composite metric weighing success, satisfaction, efficiency, survivability
- `Episode::to_memory()` - Converts to existing `Memory` type for storage
- `Episode::average_player_health()`, `count_actions()`, `action_diversity()` - Analysis helpers
- Emotional context auto-mapping based on success rating:
  - >80% = "triumphant"
  - 60-80% = "satisfied"
  - 40-60% = "uncertain"
  - 20-40% = "frustrated"
  - <20% = "defeated"

**Episode Recorder** (`astraweave-memory/src/episode_recorder.rs` - 300 LOC)
```rust
pub struct EpisodeRecorder {
    active_episodes: HashMap<String, Episode>,
    next_flush: SystemTime,
    flush_interval_secs: u64,
}

impl EpisodeRecorder {
    pub fn start_episode(&mut self, companion_id: String, category: EpisodeCategory) -> String;
    pub fn record_observation(&mut self, companion_id: &str, observation: Observation);
    pub fn end_episode(&mut self, companion_id: &str, outcome: EpisodeOutcome) -> Option<Episode>;
    pub fn tag_active_episode(&mut self, companion_id: &str, tag: String);
    pub fn complete_all_episodes(&mut self) -> Vec<Episode>; // Graceful shutdown
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- Designed as ECS resource (runs in `SystemStage::POST_SIMULATION`)
- Auto-flush timer for periodic persistence
- Supports multiple companions with independent episodes
- Graceful shutdown applies default outcomes to incomplete episodes

**Module Exports** (`astraweave-memory/src/lib.rs` - Updated)
```rust
// Episode recording system (aliased to avoid persona::Episode conflict)
pub mod episode;
pub use episode::{
    ActionResult, CompanionResponse, Episode as GameEpisode, EpisodeCategory,
    EpisodeOutcome, Observation, PlayerAction,
};

pub mod episode_recorder;
pub use episode_recorder::EpisodeRecorder;
```

**Integration Tests** (`astraweave-memory/tests/episode_tests.rs` - 473 LOC)

9 comprehensive tests covering:
1. `test_end_to_end_episode_workflow` - Full combat episode with 5 observations, tagging, outcome
2. `test_episode_to_memory_conversion` - Memory metadata, emotional context, importance scoring
3. `test_multiple_companion_episodes` - 3 companions with independent episodes
4. `test_episode_analysis_helpers` - Action counting, diversity, average health
5. `test_outcome_quality_scoring` - High/low/mixed quality scenarios
6. `test_graceful_shutdown_scenario` - Complete all active episodes on shutdown
7. `test_episode_emotional_context_mapping` - Triumphant/frustrated/satisfied emotions
8. `test_action_result_multipliers` - Success/partial/interrupted/failure multipliers
9. `test_episode_category_display` - Display format for all categories

**All tests passing** (9/9) with zero warnings from new code.

## Architecture Decisions

### ✅ Extend Existing `astraweave-memory` (Not Create New Module)

**Rationale:**
- Existing `Memory`, `MemoryMetadata`, `EmotionalContext` types provide rich foundation
- Episodes convert to `MemoryType::Episodic` instances
- Leverages existing retrieval, consolidation, forgetting systems
- Single unified memory storage (planned SQLite backend in Phase 2)

**Benefits:**
- 80% code reuse (memory types, metadata, emotional context)
- Simpler architecture (one memory system, not two)
- Episodes compatible with existing memory queries

### ✅ Episode → Memory Conversion

Episodes generate `Memory` instances with:
- **Type:** `MemoryType::Episodic`
- **Content:** Full episode JSON + descriptive text
- **Metadata:** 
  - Importance = `outcome.quality_score()`
  - Tags from episode tags
  - Confidence = 1.0 (direct experience)
  - Source = `MemorySource::DirectExperience`
- **Emotional Context:**
  - Primary emotion mapped from success_rating
  - Intensity = player_satisfaction
  - Valence = success_rating mapped to -1 to 1
  - Arousal = companion_effectiveness
- **Spatial-Temporal Context:**
  - Location from first observation world_state
  - Duration from episode timing
  - Participants = ["player", "companion", ...enemies]

### ✅ Quality Scoring Formula

```rust
quality_score = (
    success_rating * 0.4 +
    player_satisfaction * 0.3 +
    companion_effectiveness * 0.2 +
    efficiency * 0.05 +
    survivability * 0.05
).clamp(0.0, 1.0)

where:
  efficiency = damage_dealt / resources_used
  survivability = damage_dealt / (damage_dealt + damage_taken)
```

**Weights chosen to:**
- Prioritize player experience (success 40%, satisfaction 30%)
- Reward companion contribution (effectiveness 20%)
- Balance efficiency and survivability (5% each)

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Leverages Existing `astraweave-memory`

**Memory Types:**
- `Memory` - Core memory structure
- `MemoryType::Episodic` - Episode storage
- `MemoryMetadata` - Timestamps, importance, tags
- `EmotionalContext` - Sentiment from outcomes
- `SpatialTemporalContext` - Location, duration, participants

**Systems:**
- `MemoryManager` (Phase 2) - Will store episodes
- `consolidation.rs` (Phase 3) - Pattern detection from episodes
- `retrieval.rs` (existing) - Context-aware episode queries
- `forgetting.rs` (existing) - Time decay for old episodes

### Designed for ECS Integration

**Usage Pattern:**
```rust
// In astraweave-ai or astraweave-behavior:

// ECS resource
struct CompanionMemory {
    recorder: EpisodeRecorder,
    storage: MemoryStorage, // Phase 2
}

// System (POST_SIMULATION stage)
fn record_companion_observations(
    mut memory: ResMut<CompanionMemory>,
    companions: Query<(&CompanionId, &Transform, &CombatStats)>,
    player: Query<(&Transform, &CombatStats), With<Player>>,
) {
    for (companion_id, comp_trans, comp_stats) in companions.iter() {
        let (player_trans, player_stats) = player.single();
        
        let obs = Observation::new(
            /* timestamp */ game_time.elapsed_ms(),
            /* player_action */ extract_player_action(),
            /* companion_response */ extract_companion_response(),
            /* world_state */ serde_json::json!({
                "player_health": player_stats.health_ratio(),
                "companion_health": comp_stats.health_ratio(),
                "location": format!("{:?}", player_trans.translation),
            }),
        );
        
        memory.recorder.record_observation(&companion_id.0, obs);
    }
    
    // Auto-flush check
    if memory.recorder.should_flush() {
        let episodes = memory.recorder.complete_all_episodes();
        for episode in episodes {
            let memory_instance = episode.to_memory()?;
            memory.storage.store_memory(&memory_instance)?;
        }
        memory.recorder.update_flush_timer();
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

**Per Episode:**
- Base struct: ~200 bytes
- Observations: ~150 bytes each (10 obs = 1.5 KB)
- Outcome: ~50 bytes
- **Total:** ~2 KB per episode (small)

**Recorder:**
- HashMap overhead: O(companions)
- Typical: 1-4 active episodes = 8-16 KB

### CPU Performance

**Observation Recording:** O(1)
- HashMap lookup: ~50 ns
- Vec push: ~20 ns
- **Total:** <100 ns per observation

**Episode Completion:** O(observations)
- Iteration: observations * 50 ns
- Typical (10 obs): ~500 ns

**Memory Conversion:** O(observations)
- JSON serialization: observations * 1 µs
- Typical (10 obs): ~10 µs

**All operations well below frame budget (16.67 ms @ 60 FPS)**

### Storage

**Episode Data:**
- 10-minute combat: ~20 observations = 3 KB
- 100 episodes: ~300 KB
- 1,000 episodes: ~3 MB

**SQLite backend (Phase 2) will handle compression and pruning.**

## What's Next: Phase 2 - SQLite Persistence

**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours  
**Deliverables:**
1. Add `rusqlite` dependency to workspace
2. Create `astraweave-memory/src/storage.rs` with SQLite backend
3. Unified schema for `episodes` and `memories` tables
4. Migration helpers for existing in-memory data
5. Integration tests for CRUD operations
6. Performance benchmarks (write/query latency)

**Schema Design:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE memories (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    memory_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- "Episodic", "Semantic", etc.
    content_json TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Full Memory content
    metadata_json TEXT NOT NULL, -- Metadata
    embedding_blob BLOB,         -- Optional embedding
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Unix timestamp
    importance REAL NOT NULL,    -- 0.0 - 1.0
    INDEX idx_type (memory_type),
    INDEX idx_created (created_at),
    INDEX idx_importance (importance)
);

CREATE TABLE memory_tags (
    memory_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    tag TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (memory_id, tag),
    FOREIGN KEY (memory_id) REFERENCES memories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**Episode storage:** Episodes stored as `MemoryType::Episodic` in `memories` table, full JSON in `content_json`.
