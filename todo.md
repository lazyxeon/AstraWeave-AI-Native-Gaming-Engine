# World Partition System Implementation - TODO

## Phase 1: Design & Data Model (astraweave-scene)
- [x] Create world_partition module in astraweave-scene
- [x] Define WorldPartition struct with grid-based spatial partitioning
- [x] Define Cell struct to hold entity/asset references
- [x] Add AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) struct for spatial bounds
- [x] Extend scene types with spatial association methods
- [x] Add grid configuration struct (resolution, bounds, etc.)
- [x] Implement grid coordinate conversion utilities

## Phase 2: Streaming Logic (astraweave-scene + astraweave-asset)
- [x] Create WorldPartitionManager struct with async loading capabilities
- [x] Implement camera frustum culling utilities
- [x] Add cell activation/deactivation logic based on camera position
- [x] Implement async cell loading with tokio
- [x] Implement graceful cell unloading with LRU cache
- [x] Add error handling for failed loads
- [x] Implement cell overlap loading for smooth transitions

## Phase 3: Integration & Runtime
- [x] Add Scene::load_partitioned method
- [x] Create event system for CellLoaded/Unloaded events
- [x] Hook into existing scene loading system
- [x] Add memory tracking and metrics
- [x] Implement active cell limiting
- [x] Add performance monitoring utilities

## Phase 4: Testing & Demo
- [x] Write unit tests for grid assignment
- [x] Write unit tests for frustum culling
- [x] Write integration test with procedural demo scene
- [x] Create demo scene generator (10x10 grid)
- [x] Add performance benchmarks
- [x] Verify memory constraints (<500MB for 10kmÂ²)

## Phase 5: Documentation & Polish
- [x] Update Cargo.toml with world-partition feature flag
- [x] Add README section with architecture diagram
- [x] Write usage examples
- [x] Add inline documentation
- [x] Create CHANGELOG entry

## Phase 6: PR Preparation
- [ ] Create feature branch feat/world-partition
- [ ] Commit all changes with proper messages
- [ ] Push branch to GitHub
- [ ] Create draft PR with description
- [ ] Add demo scene instructions to PR
