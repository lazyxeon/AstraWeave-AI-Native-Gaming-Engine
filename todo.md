# Nanite-Inspired Virtualized Geometry Implementation

## Overview
Implementing a Nanite-inspired virtualized geometry system for AstraWeave to enable rendering of millions of polygons at interactive framerates. This system will include meshlet generation, LOD hierarchy, visibility culling, and integration with existing engine systems.

## Phase 1: Pre-Processing Pipeline (Meshlet Generation)
- [x] Create `astraweave-asset/src/nanite_preprocess.rs` module
- [x] Define `Meshlet` data structure with bounding cone, AABB, and LOD error metric
- [x] Implement meshlet generation using k-means clustering on vertices/triangles
- [x] Implement LOD hierarchy generation with edge collapse simplification
- [x] Add quadric error metrics for mesh simplification
- [x] Implement async pre-processing with tokio/rayon
- [x] Create serialization format (serde/ron) for meshlet data
- [x] Add unit tests for meshlet generation correctness

## Phase 2: Visibility Buffer System
- [x] Create `astraweave-render/src/nanite_visibility.rs` module
- [x] Implement WGSL compute shader for software rasterization
- [x] Create visibility buffer (32-bit uint texture for meshlet/triangle IDs)
- [x] Implement frustum culling for meshlets
- [x] Implement occlusion culling with Hi-Z buffer
- [x] Add LOD selection based on screen-space error
- [ ] Integrate with World Partition for per-cell meshlet streaming
- [x] Add unit tests for culling correctness

## Phase 3: Rendering Integration
- [x] Create `astraweave-render/src/nanite_render.rs` module
- [x] Extend clustered forward renderer for visibility buffer
- [x] Implement material-aware rasterization pass
- [x] Create GPU buffers (SSBOs) for meshlet storage
- [x] Integrate with existing material system
- [ ] Add GI sampling (DDGI/VXGI) on virtualized geometry
- [ ] Implement automatic meshletization for voxel terrain polygons
- [x] Add feature flag `nanite` to Cargo.toml

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [x] Create unit tests for meshlet generation
- [x] Create unit tests for culling algorithms
- [x] Create unit tests for LOD selection
- [ ] Create integration test with high-poly scene (10M+ polygons)
- [ ] Validate FPS performance (>60 FPS target)
- [ ] Validate memory usage (<500MB target)
- [ ] Test LOD transitions for smoothness
- [ ] Test integration with voxel terrain
- [ ] Test integration with World Partition streaming
- [ ] Test integration with GI systems

## Phase 5: Demo & Documentation
- [x] Create `examples/nanite_demo/` directory
- [x] Implement high-poly demo scene (10M+ polygons)
- [x] Add procedural terrain integration
- [x] Add dynamic camera movement showcase
- [x] Create `astraweave-render/NANITE.md` architecture documentation
- [x] Add ASCII/Mermaid architecture diagrams
- [x] Document usage examples
- [x] Document performance characteristics
- [x] Update main README.md with Nanite feature
- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md with feature addition

## Phase 6: Code Quality & PR Preparation
- [ ] Run clippy and fix all warnings (requires Rust installation)
- [x] Ensure zero unsafe code
- [x] Add inline documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] Verify all tests pass (requires Rust installation)
- [x] Create feature branch `feat/virtualized-geometry`
- [ ] Commit changes with message "feat: initial Nanite-inspired virtualized geometry with meshlet pipeline"
- [ ] Push branch to GitHub
- [ ] Create pull request targeting main
- [ ] Add PR description with implementation summary
