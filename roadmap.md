✅1. **3D Rendering and Visual Assets**

   * The current engine is console/log–based; there’s no graphics subsystem. You would need a rendering pipeline (e.g. wgpu or vulkan integration) with scene graph, mesh loading, shaders, animation playback and UI widgets.
   * No art assets exist yet: character models, environments, props, visual effects, and UI art need to be created or sourced.

✅2. **Physics and World Simulation**

   * The prototype uses a simple 2D grid for pathing and line‑of‑sight. A full action RPG requires a 3D physics engine (collision, rigid bodies, joints, ragdolls, kinematics) and navmesh/pathfinding suitable for complex terrain.
   * Systems such as climbing, swimming, destructible objects, and dynamic weather aren’t implemented.

✅3. **Gameplay Mechanics and Content**

   * The fate‑weaving mechanic is described in docs but not coded. Core gameplay loops like crafting, combat combos, echo infusion, resource harvesting and the consequences of “thread weaving” need to be implemented.
   * Story content (quests, dialogue, characters, cutscenes) and level design (biomes, puzzles, dungeons) are missing. A narrative writer and level designer are needed to build the 100+ hour experience promised by the concept.

4. **Audio and Dialogue Systems**

   * The engine doesn’t handle audio. Support for background music, spatial sound effects, voice‑over playback and procedural dialogue needs to be added.
   * AI‑driven companion banter will require text‑to‑speech or recorded voice lines, and a dialogue system to manage timing and variation.

5. **UI/UX and Player Controls**

   * There’s no menu system, HUD, inventory screen, map/quest log, crafting interface or accessibility options. These would need to be designed and integrated with the engine.
   * Input handling beyond simple key or mouse events (controller support, remapping, touch) must be added.

6. **AI Model Integration**

   * The repository includes a mock or local rule‑based orchestrator and placeholder for LLM calls, but not integration with a real language model API. You need to decide on an AI backend (local model, hosted service) and build wrappers, authentication, and streaming to feed world state and receive plans.
   * Safety, content filtering, latency handling and fallback behaviours should be formalized.

7. **Tools and Pipelines**

   * Level and encounter editors: Non‑programmers will need tools to author biomes, placement of obstacles, NPCs and “fate threads,” plus scripts for boss phases and director budgets.
   * Asset pipeline: import/convert textures, models, animations, and audio from DCC tools into the engine’s format.
   * Debugging and profiling tools: performance monitors, visual profilers, event logs, and hot‑reload for scripts.

8. **Networking and Multiplayer**

   * A simple WebSocket co‑op prototype exists, but full multiplayer requires robust server authority, prediction and reconciliation, matchmaking/lobbies, persistence, and anti‑cheat measures.
   * If cross‑platform play is intended, network code must handle platform differences, NAT traversal, and possibly region‑based servers.

9. **Data Persistence and Save System**

   * The engine lacks a comprehensive save/load pipeline for game progress, companion profiles, world state and player inventories.
   * Versioning and migration of save files will be needed as the game evolves.

10. **Testing, Documentation and Build Tools**

    * Unit tests and automated integration tests are largely absent. A mature project needs CI/CD scripts, test coverage, and performance benchmarks.
    * There should be developer documentation for the engine API, AI scripting, persona pack format, and authoring tools.
    * Build scripts for packaging releases on PC and the target console (including asset bundling and update patching) need to be created.

11. **Platform & Hardware Implementation**

    * The “AstraCore” console is still a theoretical specification. A real device requires hardware prototyping, operating system development, driver support, power/thermal management, and manufacturing.
    * For PC, the engine must be adapted to run efficiently on a variety of GPUs, CPUs and operating systems, with minimum and recommended specs defined.

By filling in these missing pieces—graphics and physics, gameplay systems, toolchain, full AI integration, network infrastructure, and production‑ready tooling, the Veilweaver project can move from proof‑of‑concept to a playable, scalable game and engine.
