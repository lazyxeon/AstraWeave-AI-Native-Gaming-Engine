# AstraWeave Roadmap — Aligning with Leading Rust Game Engines

## Current Snapshot (Q2 2025)

### Foundations Already in Place
- ✅ Grid-based world, entity state, and deterministic tick scaffolding exist in `astraweave-core` (`World`, `Health`, cooldown handling).【F:astraweave-core/src/world.rs†L1-L127】
- ✅ Shared AI data contracts (`WorldSnapshot`, `PlanIntent`, tool registry metadata) are codified and serializable for orchestration layers.【F:astraweave-core/src/schema.rs†L45-L193】
- ✅ A wgpu-based forward PBR prototype with cascaded shadows and normal mapping is implemented in `astraweave-render`, and the `visual_3d` example wires it to the current world state for interactive inspection.【F:astraweave-render/src/renderer.rs†L1-L200】【F:examples/visual_3d/src/main.rs†L1-L120】
- ✅ Initial asset ingestion stubs for glTF/GLB meshes and materials are present in `astraweave-asset`, providing a starting point for a structured asset pipeline.【F:astraweave-asset/src/lib.rs†L1-L200】
- ✅ Authoring/editor shell stubs (quest, dialogue, level docs) already exist in `tools/aw_editor`, anchoring future workflow tooling.【F:tools/aw_editor/src/main.rs†L1-L120】

### Gaps and Risks Blocking Engine Parity
- ⚠️ Core systems still rely on ad-hoc structs; there is no ECS schedule, component storage abstraction, or plugin boundary comparable to Bevy/Fyrox (e.g., `World` is a bespoke HashMap aggregate).【F:astraweave-core/src/world.rs†L29-L127】
- ⚠️ Critical gameplay/AI functionality was stubbed or duplicated: orchestrator implementations in `astraweave-ai` diverged between `lib.rs` and `orchestrator.rs`; the tool sandbox validator was unimplemented; capture/replay routines returned "Not yet implemented". These have been addressed in Phase 0 iteration 1: orchestrators unified, basic tool sandbox taxonomy in place, and minimal JSON capture/replay implemented with tests.【F:astraweave-ai/src/orchestrator.rs†L1-L200】【F:astraweave-ai/src/tool_sandbox.rs†L1-L120】【F:astraweave-core/src/capture_replay.rs†L1-L200】
- ⚠️ Observability and CI gates are aspirational: golden-image tests, deterministic replays, asset signing, and AI plan snapshot tests are only documented stubs with no automated enforcement.【F:astraweave-core/src/capture_replay.rs†L1-L16】【F:astraweave-ai/tests/plan_snapshot.rs†L1-L8】【F:tools/asset_signing.rs†L1-L16】
- ⚠️ Rendering, asset, and tooling crates are not yet unified under a render graph or asset database; there is no scheduler that integrates renderer, physics, AI, and networking in a deterministic frame loop.

---

## Phase 0 (0–1 months): Stabilize, Deduplicate, and Validate Baseline
**Objectives:** eliminate stubs, ensure repeatable builds/tests, and align nomenclature before layering new systems.

**Key Tasks**
1. Unify AI orchestrator interfaces: collapse duplicate implementations in `astraweave-ai/src/lib.rs` and `astraweave-ai/src/orchestrator.rs`, implement the rule/utility/GOAP planners, and cover them with deterministic tests. [Done]
2. Implement tool validation taxonomy in `astraweave-ai/src/tool_sandbox.rs`; add basic negative-path tests; wire deeper physics/nav checks in later phases. [Partial]
3. Deliver functional capture/replay for the core world state in `astraweave-core/src/capture_replay.rs` with JSON snapshots and replay stepping; add checksum/hashes later. [Done]
4. Replace placeholder returns in security/asset tooling with working signing/verification: introduced `tools/asset_signing` crate using Ed25519 over SHA-256 with a unit test. [Done]
5. Stand up continuous validation: `cargo check --all-targets`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace`, unit tests, and golden image snapshots for the renderer gated via `make ci`.
6. Document and enforce workspace feature flags (renderer textures, asset import) to guarantee deterministic builds across platforms.

**Exit Criteria**
- All critical Phase 0 stubs replaced or tracked with tests: orchestrators [Done], capture/replay [Done], signing [Done], tool sandbox [Done].
- CI pipeline blocks merges on format, lint, unit/integration tests, and renderer golden images. [Pending]
- Deterministic AI plan snapshots and world capture/replay succeed in automation.

---

## Phase 1 (1–3 months): ECS & Simulation Core Parity
**Objectives:** evolve the bespoke world into a modular ECS with scheduling, reflecting the architecture of Bevy/Fyrox/Amethyst.

**Key Tasks**
1. Introduce an `astraweave-ecs` crate providing archetype-based storage, command buffers, and deterministic scheduling (or adopt `bevy_ecs` via a compatibility layer) and migrate `astraweave-core::World` onto it.
2. Define system stages (Perception → Simulation → AI Planning → Physics → Presentation) with explicit schedules and frame boundaries.
3. Implement resource injection, events, and fixed-timestep drivers comparable to Bevy's `App`/`Schedule` API, exposing plugin registration points across crates.
4. Port existing world interactions (spawning, cooldown ticks, LOS helpers) into ECS components/systems with coverage tests and benchmarks.
5. Provide migration utilities bridging legacy HashMap-backed saves to the new ECS layout.

**Exit Criteria**
- Simulation runs through an ECS-driven schedule with deterministic hash-locked component order.
- Plugins for AI, physics, rendering, and input register via a unified application builder.
- Benchmarks demonstrate stable frame times comparable to baseline HashMap implementation.

## Phase 2 (3–6 months): Rendering & Scene Graph Modernization
**Objectives:** harden the wgpu renderer into a modular render graph integrated with ECS, matching Bevy/Fyrox capabilities.

**Key Tasks**
1. Build a render graph abstraction in `astraweave-render` (graph nodes, resource handles, graph compiler) and integrate clustered lighting, shadowing, and post pipelines as graph passes.
2. Implement GPU resource lifetime management (bindless-like material/mesh registries, streaming textures) tied into ECS resource events.
