# Veilweaver • AstraWeave • AstraCore

**Veilweaver: Threads of Eternity** — a flagship **AI‑native action RPG** where your **AI companion** learns across playthroughs and **AI endbosses** evolve against your tactics.  
**AstraWeave** — a custom, AI‑first game engine that makes agents (companions & bosses) first‑class citizens.  
**AstraCore** — a companion‑centric, AI‑accelerated console platform designed to run AI gameplay locally with low latency.

> High‑level concepts for Veilweaver were originally defined in a pitch that explored a quantum‑inspired archipelago, fate‑weaving mechanics, and 100+ hours of emergent RPG gameplay. We carry those pillars forward and make them AI‑native here. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Two‑minute pitch

- **Your AI companion** is persistent. It learns your style, remembers your victories, and travels with you across titles built on AstraWeave.
- **AI endbosses** act like living game masters: they scout you, alter environments (fortify, flood, collapse, lure), and counter your favorite tactics.
- **Every run is personal**: fate‑weaving + adaptive agents reshape levels, quests, and boss playbooks so replays never feel the same. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## License & ethos

- **No pay‑to‑win. No loot boxes.** Expansions must be meaty, optional, and never fragment core content.  
- Player data & companion memory stay on‑device by default. Cloud is optional and transparent.  
- Creator marketplace allows personas/modules/maps with strict anti‑exploit curation.
