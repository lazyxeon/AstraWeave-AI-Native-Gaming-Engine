## Overview

**AstraWeave** is a deterministic, ECS-based game engine where **AI agents are first-class citizens**. Unlike traditional engines where AI is bolted on as an afterthought, AstraWeave implements the core AI loop (**Perception → Reasoning → Planning → Action**) directly into the simulation architecture.

### AI-Native Creation Process

AstraWeave itself is the outcome of an **iterative, multi-model AI collaboration pipeline**. Every architectural decision, line of code, asset, and document in this repository was generated through coordinated AI workflows—no human-authored code or content is present. The project functions simultaneously as:

- **A living experiment in specialized AI workflows**, showcasing how model ensembles can refine complex systems through continuous feedback, validation, and tooling integration.
- **An aspiring fully functional AI-native game engine**, proving that autonomous AI teams can design, implement, and evolve production-grade interactive technology end-to-end.

This README, the surrounding documentation, and the engine codebase are therefore both a technical artifact and a case study in AI-led software creation. Each iteration has been captured, validated, and merged by AI agents operating under deterministic processes to ensure reliability, traceability, and reproducibility without human intervention.

### Key Differentiators

🧠 **AI-Native Architecture** - Agents plan through sandboxed tools with full engine validation  
🎯 **Deterministic Simulation** - 60Hz fixed-tick simulation with authoritative validation  
🛡️ **Tool Sandbox Security** - AI can only act through validated verbs (no cheating)  
🤝 **Persistent Companions** - AI profiles that learn and adapt across sessions  
🎭 **Adaptive Boss Systems** - Directors that evolve tactics and reshape battlefields  
🌐 **Local-First AI** - 7B-12B quantized LLMs for low-latency decisions  

### Built for Developers Who Want

- **Rich AI companions** that actually learn from player behavior
- **Dynamic bosses** that adapt their strategies based on player tactics  
- **Emergent gameplay** from AI agent interactions
- **Server-authoritative multiplayer** with AI agent synchronization
- **Rapid prototyping** of AI-driven game concepts


### Why AstraWeave Matters

🎯 **Market Opportunity**: Game engines ($2.8B market) lack true AI innovation  
🚀 **First-Mover Advantage**: Only production-ready AI-native engine

## Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

Get up and running in seconds with our automated bootstrap script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lazyxeon/AstraWeave-AI-Native-Gaming-Engine.git
cd AstraWeave-AI-Native-Gaming-Engine

# One-command setup (installs dependencies + validates environment)
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Or use make for convenience
make setup
```

The bootstrap script will:
- 🔍 **Detect your platform** (Linux distro, macOS, Windows/WSL)

## Examples & Demos

AstraWeave includes 20+ examples demonstrating engine capabilities. Note that this is an active development project, so some examples may have compilation issues due to API evolution.


### Core AI & Engine Examples (Working)
```bash
# Basic AI companion with planning and validation  
cargo run -p hello_companion --release
# Demonstrates: AI perception, planning, tool validation
# Expected: Shows AI plan generation, then panics on LOS logic (expected behavior)

# Cinematics timeline/sequencer (timeline load/save, camera/audio/FX tracks)
# (UI panel: open Cinematics window in working UI examples)

# Adaptive boss with multi-phase behavior
cargo run -p adaptive_boss --release

# Companion profile management
cargo run -p companion_profile --release
```


### Working Core Engine Builds
```bash
# Build stable core components (Phase 4: SDK ABI, CI, Cinematics, UI)
cargo build -p astraweave-core -p astraweave-ai -p astraweave-physics \
            -p astraweave-nav -p astraweave-render -p hello_companion

# Run unit tests on input system
cargo test -p astraweave-input
```


### Development Notes
> **Note**: Some examples have compilation issues due to API evolution:
> - Graphics examples (`visual_3d`, `ui_controls_demo`) have egui/winit API mismatches
> - Some gameplay demos need dependency updates (`serde_json` missing)
> - `astraweave-author` has rhai sync/send trait issues
>
> **Phase 4 Complete:** SDK ABI, C harness, CI semver gate, cinematics timeline/sequencer, and UI timeline load/save are all implemented and validated. Focus on the working core components and `hello_companion` for understanding the engine architecture.
