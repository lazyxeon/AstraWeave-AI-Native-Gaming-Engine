## 🎯 Overview

AstraWeave is a **production-validated, deterministic, ECS-based game engine** where AI agents are first-class citizens. Built end-to-end in Rust and powered by wgpu, Rayon, and Tokio, the engine integrates neural inference directly into the simulation core so cognition and rendering evolve in lockstep. Unlike traditional engines where AI is bolted on as an afterthought, AstraWeave implements intelligent behavior directly into the simulation architecture—**and we've proven it works**.

The project is fully AI-authored and has been vetted through a multi-stage validation program culminating in an **A+ readiness grade** documented in the [AI Native Validation Report](docs/root-archive/AI_NATIVE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md).

> 📁 **Documentation update:** All legacy root-level reports now reside in [`docs/root-archive/`](docs/root-archive/README.md). The workspace root only tracks source code and the primary README.

## 🌠 Core Features

- 🧠 **AI-Native Architecture** – Tightly-coupled ECS systems for perception, reasoning, planning, and action
- 🌀 **Fractal Rendering Pipeline** – Hybrid voxel/polygon renderer with adaptive recursion and wgpu acceleration
- ⚙️ **Deterministic Simulation** – Fixed 60 Hz tick, replay-safe networking, and validated concurrency safety
- 🌍 **Procedural Worlds** – Terrain, biomes, and materials synthesized in real time with streaming asset pipelines
- 🎮 **Extensible Toolkit** – Modular crates for gameplay logic, simulation, and agent cognition ready for production

#### 🤖 **GOAP+Hermes Hybrid Arbiter** (NEW)

The **AIArbiter** combines instant tactical decisions with deep LLM reasoning for **zero user-facing latency**:

- **⚡ Performance**: 101.7 ns GOAP control (982× faster than 100 µs target)
- **📊 Scalability**: 1,000 AI agents @ 60 FPS = 0.6% frame budget, 10,000 agents = 6.1%

**How it works**: Agents respond instantly with GOAP tactical AI while LLM plans generate in the background. When complete, agents smoothly transition to executing strategic LLM plans, then return to GOAP for the next challenge.

**Try it now**:
```bash
# Run with arbiter (zero-latency hybrid control)
cargo run -p hello_companion --release --features llm_orchestrator -- --arbiter

# Run GOAP-only mode (for comparison)

```bash---

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/lazyxeon/AstraWeave-AI-Native-Gaming-Engine.git## Architecture Overview

### AI-First Loop (Core Pattern)

```
Perception → Reasoning → Planning → Action
    ↓           ↓            ↓          ↓
WorldSnapshot  AI Model   PlanIntent  Tool Validation
```

**Key Concepts**:
- `WorldSnapshot`: Filtered world state for AI perception
- `PlanIntent` + `ActionStep`: AI decisions as validated action sequences
- `Orchestrator` trait: Abstracts AI planning (rule-based vs LLM)
- **Tool Sandbox**: All AI actions validated by engine (no cheating possible)

### ECS System Stages

Deterministic, ordered execution:

1. **PRE_SIMULATION** - Setup, initialization
2. **PERCEPTION** - Build WorldSnapshots, update AI sensors
3. **SIMULATION** - Game logic, cooldowns, state updates
4. **AI_PLANNING** - Generate PlanIntents from orchestrators
5. **PHYSICS** - Apply forces, resolve collisions
6. **POST_SIMULATION** - Cleanup, constraint resolution
7. **PRESENTATION** - Rendering, audio, UI updates

**Fixed 60Hz tick** with deterministic RNG and ordered entity iteration.

### Validation-First Design

Every AI action is validated by the engine:

- **Line of sight** calculations
- **Cooldown** enforcement  
- **Resource** availability
- **Physics** constraints
- **Navigation** validity

**Validated**: 6.48M checks/sec, 100% invalid action rejection

With **12,700+ agent capacity** and **perfect determinism**, AstraWeave enables:

### Massive Strategy Games

- **10,000+ units** with individual AI behavior
- Real-time tactical planning and formations
- Deterministic replays for competitive play
- *Example: Total War-scale battles with smart units*

### Living Open Worlds

- **1,000+ NPCs** with daily routines and emergent behavior
- Dynamic faction warfare and territory control
- Procedural quests responding to world state
- *Example: Skyrim with genuinely intelligent citizens*

### Competitive Multiplayer

- 100% deterministic simulation for fairness
- Server-authoritative validation (6.48M checks/sec)
- Perfect replay systems for tournaments
- *Example: StarCraft with adaptive AI opponents*

### AI-Driven Boss Fights

- Multi-phase adaptive bosses that learn player tactics
- Real-time strategy evolution during encounters
- Complex coordination between boss phases
- *Example: Souls-like with truly intelligent enemies*

## 🎯 Next: Phase 8 - Game Engine Readiness (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal**: Transform from "production-ready infrastructure" to "ship a game on it"  
**Timeline**: 6-7 months (Phases 8-9) for single-player game engine  
**Current Gap**: 60-70% complete for shipping full games  

### 🥇 Priority 1: In-Game UI Framework (4-5 weeks) - STARTING NOW

- Main menu, pause menu, settings
- HUD system (health bars, objectives, minimap)
- UI animations, controller support, accessibility

### 🥈 Priority 2: Complete Rendering Pipeline (4-6 weeks)

- Shadow mapping (CSM + omnidirectional)
- Skybox/atmosphere rendering
- Post-processing stack (bloom, tonemapping, SSAO)
- Dynamic lighting (point/spot/directional)
- Particle system (GPU-accelerated)
- Volumetric fog/lighting

### 🥉 Priority 3: Save/Load System (2-3 weeks)

- Serialize ECS world state
- Player profile (settings, unlocks, stats)
- Save slot management with versioning
- Corruption detection and recovery

### 🏅 Priority 4: Production Audio (3-4 weeks)

- Audio mixer (master, music, SFX, voice buses)
- Dynamic music (layers, crossfades)
- Audio occlusion and reverb zones
- In-editor audio tools

## 📚 Examples & Demos

AstraWeave includes 20+ examples demonstrating engine capabilities:

### Working Examples

```bash
# Basic AI companion with planning and validation  
cargo run -p hello_companion --release

# Profiling demo with Tracy integration (Week 8)
cargo run -p profiling_demo --release -- --entities 1000

# Unified showcase with biome rendering
cargo run -p unified_showcase --release

# AI core loop demos
cargo run -p core_loop_bt_demo --release      # Behavior trees
cargo run -p core_loop_goap_demo --release    # GOAP planning
```

### Development Notes

> **Note**: This is an active development project. Some examples have compilation issues due to API evolution:
> - Graphics examples (`ui_controls_demo`, `debug_overlay`) have egui/winit API mismatches
> - Some gameplay demos need dependency updates
> - `astraweave-author` has rhai sync/send trait issues
>
> Focus on the working core components and `hello_companion` for understanding the engine architecture.
