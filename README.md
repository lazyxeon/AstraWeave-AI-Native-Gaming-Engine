### 🔍 Engine Health Status (February 26, 2026)

✅ **MIRI + KANI FORMAL VERIFICATION COMPLETE** — [Miri Report](docs/current/MIRI_VALIDATION_REPORT.md) | [Coverage Report](docs/current/MASTER_COVERAGE_REPORT.md)

**🏆 Production-Grade Quality**: AstraWeave has **~27,000+ passing tests** across **49 production crates** (28 measured via LLVM source-based coverage) with **59.3% weighted coverage** — 14 crates at 85%+ including ECS (96.39%), Physics (94.38%), and Nav (93.11%). All unsafe code is **Miri-validated** and **Kani-verified** for memory safety.

| Metric | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Coverage** | ✅ **59.3% weighted** (P0: 55.4%, P1: 58.9%, P2: 73.9%) | **28 crates measured** via `cargo llvm-cov` |
| **Tests** | ✅ **~27,000+ passing** | 14/28 crates ≥ 85% coverage |
| **Memory Safety** | ✅ **Miri-Validated** | 977 tests, **0 undefined behavior** across 4 crates |
| **Formal Verification** | ✅ **Kani-Verified** | 69 proof harnesses across 4 crates |
| **Mutation Testing** | ✅ **2,028+ tests** | Wave 1: 767 manual + Wave 2: 1,261+ automated (100% kill rate) |
| **Determinism** | ✅ **100% bit-identical** | Replay validation, 5-run consistency |
| **Health Grade** | ✅ **B+** | Strong quality, GPU/async code lowers weighted average |

> **Why 59.3%?** Previous reports claimed 94.57% using manual source-file filtering. The v5.0 methodology uses `cargo llvm-cov --lib --summary-only` which instruments all compiled code including inlined dependency generics. Large GPU-only and async code paths (rendering: 37,035 lines, terrain: 18,826 lines, audio: 11,662 lines) are untestable in headless mode. See [MASTER_COVERAGE_REPORT](docs/current/MASTER_COVERAGE_REPORT.md) for full analysis.

**Miri Validated**: astraweave-ecs (386 tests), astraweave-math (109 tests), astraweave-core (465 tests), astraweave-sdk (17 tests) — **ZERO undefined behavior** | [MIRI_VALIDATION_REPORT](docs/current/MIRI_VALIDATION_REPORT.md)

**Unsafe Code Validated**: BlobVec, SparseSet, EntityAllocator, SIMD intrinsics (SSE2), C ABI FFI functions — all memory-safe ✅

## 🌌 Why AstraWeave?

Traditional game engines bolt AI onto simulation. **AstraWeave weaves AI into the core.**

In AstraWeave, the "Game Loop" is an **Intelligence Loop**:
1.  **Perception**: Agents "see" the world through a snapshot system.
2.  **Reasoning**: LLMs and Utility systems analyze the state.
3.  **Planning**: GOAP and Behavior Trees formulate plans.
4.  **Action**: Plans execute via deterministic ECS commands.

This architecture enables **12,700+ intelligent agents** running at **60 FPS** with complex reasoning, not just simple state machines.
