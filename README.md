> **What changed (June 2026)?** Five campaigns closed and one advanced since the May snapshot. **Net-Trio-Remediation** (Jun 9–10) fixed the long-standing matchmaking-trio signature defect: canonical HMAC-SHA256 sign/verify in `aw-net-proto` (XOR `sign16` stub deleted), client and server share the same surface, the server verifies *before* any state mutation and **kicks by default** (`SignatureFailurePolicy::Kick`, WebSocket Close 1008), with TLS-path coverage — 104 trio regression tests, all green. **Unified Camera C.0–C.9** (closed Jun 1) consolidated 8 divergent camera codepaths into the new [`astraweave-camera`](astraweave-camera/) crate (`RenderView` as the sole upload payload; dual renderer upload paths and 3 parallel cinematics keyframe systems retired, net −1,549 LoC in C.6 alone). **Editor-Engine Render Parity P.1–P.7** (closed May 17) established a bit-identical (SHA-256) editor↔engine WYSIWYG contract with a public regression harness — five seams structurally protected. **Editor Multi-Tool Architecture** Sub-phases 3 and 4 closed (May 14 / Jun 6); Sub-phase 5 is in flight (5.A/5.B landed Jun 6). **Terrain Asset Quality** (closed Jun 2) baselined terrain texture VRAM at 80 MiB per active pack (31% of the 256 MB soft budget) and flagged the BC7/KTX2 cook path as non-functional (runtime uploads uncompressed RGBA8). A live build audit (Jun 10) confirmed all 130 workspace members compile clean — every entry on the former known-build-issues list (rhai authoring crates, egui demos, astraweave-llm) now passes `cargo check`.

<!-- Source: ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md v0.7.0 revision history; §0 Trace Index;
     §5 Dormant-Code Inventory; §7 Documentation Hazards. -->
> **What changed (May 2026)?** The **architecture trace campaign** completed 13 per-subsystem traces under `docs/architecture/` (terrain materials, render pipeline, physics, persistence-ECS, networking ×2, input, fluids, ECS/math/core/SDK foundation, audio, animation, AI pipeline, aw_editor). The [Architecture Map](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) was reconciled to v0.7.0 against those traces, and the [Interactive Workspace Map](https://lazyxeon.github.io/AstraWeave/architecture/) was deployed. Specific documentation hazards were surfaced and corrected: Fluids reclassified as research surface (no production game-loop dep), the runtime LLM default drift from Qwen to `phi3:medium` was identified and later replaced with `qwen3.5:4b`, dual `World` coexistence (legacy `core::World` + ECS substrate) documented, four parallel animation type families catalogued, and the §7.7 wrapped-component resource identity trap promoted to a workspace-wide structural axiom.
>
> **Why 57.35%?** The whole-workspace measurement (`cargo llvm-cov --workspace`) counts all ~51 production + bin/tool crate source — including large GPU-only and async code paths (rendering, terrain, audio) that are hard to exercise in headless mode. It supersedes the earlier 59.3%, which measured only a 29-crate curated subset (a higher number because it excluded the lower-coverage crates — a denominator change, not a regression). See [MASTER_COVERAGE_REPORT](docs/current/MASTER_COVERAGE_REPORT.md) for full analysis.
>
> **What changed (April 2026)?** The editor underwent a comprehensive [Behavioral Correctness Audit](docs/current/EDITOR_BEHAVIORAL_CORRECTNESS_AUDIT.md): 37 fixes across 48 commits addressing shader math (GGX NDF, Fresnel energy conservation, multi-scatter compensation), undo system completion (all 9 operations now undoable), silent failure resolution (60 patterns identified, critical ones fixed), and a [7-phase architectural refactor](docs/current/FIX27_UNIFIED_PIPELINE_CAMPAIGN.md) that eliminated the dual rendering pipeline (-4,669 LOC). Health grade upgraded from B+ to A- reflecting the correctness improvements.

**Miri Validated**: astraweave-ecs (419 tests), astraweave-math (109 tests), astraweave-core (503 tests), astraweave-sdk (28 tests) = **1,059** — **ZERO undefined behavior** | [MIRI_VALIDATION_REPORT](docs/current/MIRI_VALIDATION_REPORT.md)

**Unsafe Code Validated**: BlobVec, SparseSet, EntityAllocator, SIMD intrinsics (SSE2), C ABI FFI functions — all memory-safe ✅

**Key Documentation**:
- [Architecture Map](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) — Crate relationships, editor viewport pipeline, data flow diagrams (v0.7.2; the v0.7.0 pass reconciled it against the 13 subsystem traces, v0.7.1–0.7.2 are incremental campaign reconciliations)
- 🕸️ [**Interactive Workspace Map**](https://lazyxeon.github.io/AstraWeave/architecture/) — Cytoscape.js-powered live visualization of 72 workspace nodes (50 production crates, 12 tools, 10 supporting members) and 190 dependency edges. Hover or click any node for crate detail (domain, status, LoC, trace link); click any edge for the load-bearing types flowing across the boundary. Toggle **blast-radius highlighting** to see what depends on a crate before you change it, or launch the **8-step guided tour** for a 10-minute architectural walk-through. Domain filter, focus mode, dependency-path finder, and shareable URL-hash state make it the fastest way to orient in the 850 K+ LoC workspace.

## 🔍 Engineering Methodology: The Architecture Trace Campaign

AstraWeave's architecture is documented through a forensic trace campaign covering **13 subsystems** under [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/). Each trace is **evidence-grounded, version-controlled, and explicitly separates load-bearing code from in-design surface**. Trace docs are part of the production contract: when subsystem code changes, the trace updates in the same commit (see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)).

The campaign produced three artifacts that together form the engine's navigational surface:

-   **[Architecture Map](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md)** — the ~1,000-line consolidated synthesis. Crate dependency graph, structural axioms, dormant-code inventory (~200K LoC across six categories), integration seams with risk levels, data flow paths, 23 cross-cutting open questions (net-trio Q17 resolved 2026-06-10). v0.7.2 reconciled 2026-06-10.
-   **[Interactive Workspace Map](https://lazyxeon.github.io/AstraWeave/architecture/)** — Cytoscape.js visualization of the 130-member workspace. Surfaces production-wired core (ECS, AI pipeline, rendering, terrain, editor) alongside ~200K LoC of dormant-but-designed surface. Click any node for crate detail, any edge for load-bearing types, or run the 8-step guided tour.
-   **[13 subsystem traces](docs/architecture/)** — terrain materials, render pipeline, physics, persistence-ECS, net, net-ECS, input, fluids, ECS/math/core/SDK foundation, audio, animation, AI pipeline, aw_editor. Each trace is forensic: §5 file map, §6 conflict map, §7 decision log, §8 invariants, §11 open questions.

The methodology — applying forensic auditing as a counterweight to AI-generated documentation drift — is part of the **[Genesis Code Protocol (GCP)](CLAUDE.md)** approach to AI-augmented development. Cross-cutting structural rules surfaced by the campaign (the §7.7 wrapped-component resource identity trap, the no-second-implementation Fix-27 lesson, the "wired beats tested" axiom, the silent-failure policy) are documented in [`ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) §4 and applied across the workspace.

## 🌌 Why AstraWeave?

Traditional game engines bolt AI onto simulation. **AstraWeave weaves AI into the core.**

In AstraWeave, the "Game Loop" is an **Intelligence Loop**:
1.  **Perception**: Agents "see" the world through a snapshot system.
2.  **Reasoning**: LLMs and Utility systems analyze the state.
3.  **Planning**: GOAP and Behavior Trees formulate plans.
4.  **Action**: Plans execute via deterministic ECS commands.

<!-- Source: ai_pipeline.md §1. Hardware context appended per
     Correction 10 — single-figure claims need reference-hardware context. -->
This architecture enables **12,700+ intelligent agents** running at **60 FPS** with complex reasoning on reference hardware (HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop — [benchmarks](docs/masters/MASTER_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md#benchmark-hardware)), not just simple state machines.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The diagram below is the **high-level Intelligence Loop** abstraction; the actual ECS scheduler runs an **8-stage canonical pipeline** described below the diagram. See [`ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) §3 for the full data flow.

<!-- Source: ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md §3 and CLAUDE.md ECS System Stages. Was
     "7-Stage" with the wrong stage list; reconciled to actual 8 stages. -->
**8-Stage Deterministic ECS Pipeline** (executed in canonical order, single-threaded per tick):
1. `PRE_SIMULATION` → 2. `PERCEPTION` → 3. `SIMULATION` → 4. `SYNC` (ECS ↔ legacy `core::World`) → 5. `AI_PLANNING` → 6. `PHYSICS` → 7. `POST_SIMULATION` → 8. `PRESENTATION`

Systems within a stage execute in registration order; stages execute in the order above. `ParallelSchedule` was removed 2026-04-18 (see [`docs/audits/parallel_schedule_removal_2026-04-18.md`](docs/audits/parallel_schedule_removal_2026-04-18.md)); parallelism lives at the subsystem level (rayon for terrain meshing; tokio for I/O and LLM inference; GPU compute for rendering).

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 AI & Agents
  <!-- Source: active Ollama defaults in astraweave-llm/src/qwen3_ollama.rs and examples. -->
  **Multi-Modal Intelligence**: 6 validated AI modes (GOAP, Behavior Trees, LLM, Hybrid ensembles). Local LLM via Ollama — model configurable via `OLLAMA_MODEL` and defaults to Qwen (`qwen3.5:4b`) for active examples and probes.
  
  <!-- Source: ai_pipeline.md §1 (12,700+ agents validated). Hardware context
       added per Correction 10. -->
  **Massive Scale**: Orchestrates 12,700+ agents @ 60 FPS on reference hardware (HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop — see [benchmark hardware spec](docs/masters/MASTER_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md#benchmark-hardware)).
  
  <!-- Source: ai_pipeline.md §13.7 (LLM Production Hardening is ~15K LoC of
       dormant surface — the runtime AIArbiter path bypasses it entirely).
       Claim revised to describe what is actually wired. -->
  **LLM Integration**: Streaming API, batch executor, response caching, and tool-sandbox validation are production-wired. The broader production-hardening surface (rate limiting, circuit breakers, A/B routing, 4-tier fallback — ~15K LoC) ships as research surface and is currently bypassed by the runtime arbiter path. Q4 in [`ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) §14.
  
  **Dynamic Terrain**: ✅ **Production** AI-orchestrated terrain generation with LLM integration.
  
  **Scripting**: **Active/Alpha** Rhai-based scripting system for behavior logic (`astraweave-scripting`).
  
  **Generative AI**: **Experimental** Asset generation pipeline (`astraweave-ai-gen`).

### ⚙️ Core Engine
  **Deterministic ECS**: Single-threaded archetype scheduler with 100% bit-identical replay validation and **Miri-validated memory safety**. Systems execute in a fixed stage order on one thread per tick; parallelism lives at the subsystem level, not inside the schedule. See [`docs/audits/parallel_schedule_removal_2026-04-18.md`](docs/audits/parallel_schedule_removal_2026-04-18.md) for the rationale behind the single-threaded-ECS choice.

  **Subsystem parallelism**: rayon drives terrain chunk meshing ([`astraweave-terrain`](astraweave-terrain/)); tokio drives async asset streaming, LLM inference, and network I/O. GPU compute handles rendering and shader work. Where the engine spends multi-core budget today is these subsystems — not the ECS tick loop. (The former SPH fluid simulation that also used rayon was removed in the W.1 water-successor deprecation, 2026-06-20.)

  **Memory Safety**: All unsafe code validated with Miri (1,059 tests, 0 UB).

  **Sequential throughput**: at 1000 entities on the reference `profiling_demo` workload, sequential ECS median ~1 760 FPS with `fast-alloc` (mimalloc), ~1 200 FPS on the platform default allocator — measured with allocation-counter instrumentation active, across three runs each, per [`docs/audits/schedule_stage_fix_2026-04-18.md`](docs/audits/schedule_stage_fix_2026-04-18.md) §4. Scaling is approximately inverse to entity count (200e ≈ 10 k FPS, 2000e ≈ 940 FPS, 4000e ≈ 449 FPS). These numbers are measurement baselines, not shipping numbers.

  **Performance**: Fixed 60Hz simulation, SIMD acceleration (glam), cache-friendly archetype storage.

  **Networking**: Client-server architecture with delta encoding and state synchronization.

  **Persistence**: ECS world save/load with version migration.

### 🎨 Rendering (wgpu)
 **AAA Pipeline**: Disney BRDF with multi-scatter energy compensation (Turquin 2019), IBL via prefiltered cubemaps, and clustered forward lighting (100k+ lights).
 
 **Advanced Effects**: VXGI, Volumetric Fog, SSAO, SSR, Bloom, DOF, Motion Blur, 4-cascade CSM shadows with frustum fitting + texel-snap stabilization.
 
 **Optimization**: Nanite-inspired virtualized geometry, GPU occlusion culling, 3-channel DFG LUT (GGX + cloth sheen).
 
 **Materials**: Advanced shaders (Clearcoat, Sheen/Charlie, SSS, Anisotropy). Tonemapping: ACES (default), AgX, Reinhard — one shared post pipeline for engine and editor.
 
 **Unified Editor Pipeline**: Editor viewport renders through the engine — single source of truth for PBR, shadows, IBL, and post-processing, enforced by a bit-identical (SHA-256) editor↔engine parity harness (Render Parity P.1–P.7, May 2026). See [Architecture Map](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md).

### 🍎 Physics & Simulation
 **Rapier3D Integration**: Rigid bodies, character controllers, and spatial queries.
 
 **Navigation**: Navmesh generation (Delaunay) + A* pathfinding (142k queries/sec).
 
 **Terrain**: Voxel-based terrain with AI-orchestrated dynamic modification.
 
 **Audio**: Spatial audio with occlusion and dialogue runtime.

| **Networking** | 🔧 Two Coexisting Subsystems | Snapshot-based (`astraweave-net`, JSON/WebSocket) and ECS Plugin (`astraweave-net-ecs`) with **disjoint data models**. Standalone matchmaking trio (`aw-net-{proto,client,server}`): HMAC-SHA256 input signing canonical and enforced end-to-end — server verifies first and kicks by default (`SignatureFailurePolicy::Kick`); XOR `sign16` stub deleted (Net-Trio-Remediation, 2026-06-10; 104 tests). Deliberate boundaries: no replay protection; server→client unsigned (asymmetric-trust design). See [`net_ecs.md`](docs/architecture/net_ecs.md). |
| **Prompts** | ✅ Production Ready | 1,375 tests (556 lib + 819 integration), 100% mutation kill rate (792 mutants). |
| **Scripting** (`astraweave-scripting`) | ⚠️ Alpha | 128 tests (45 lib + 83 integration), functional Rhai integration. Authoring tooling layer (`astraweave-author`, `rhai_authoring`) now compiles clean (former Rhai `Sync` trait errors resolved — verified 2026-06-10). |
| **UI Framework** | ✅ Production Ready | 751 tests (320 lib + 431 integration), functional coverage. |
| **LLM Support** | ✅ Production Ready (core) / 🔬 Hardening Layer | 16,776 lines. Core inference pipeline + tool sandbox is production-wired. The ~15K LoC production-hardening surface (rate limiting, circuit breakers, A/B routing, 4-tier fallback) is dormant — Q4 in §14. |
| **Fluids** | 🔬 Research Surface (deprecated sim) | 738 test markers <!-- Source: CLAIMS_REGISTRY.md#fluids-test-markers -->. W.1 (2026-06-20) removed the SPH/voxel solver (−58.8K LoC); the crate is now ~24.2K LoC — the deprecated PBD remnant plus the retained F.4 GPU-particle accent substrate (`FluidSystem` + `WaterEffectsManager`; `PcisphSystem`/`UnifiedSolver` deleted). Only `examples/` consume it; no production game-loop crate depends on `astraweave-fluids`. The live water system is the view-side successor — `astraweave-water` facade + `astraweave-render/src/water.rs`, see [`water.md`](docs/architecture/water.md). Q12 in §14. See [`fluids.md`](docs/architecture/fluids.md). |
| **Memory / Coordination / RAG** | 🔬 Research Surface | Memory pipeline ~11K, Coordination ~5.3K, RAG composite ~12.3K. Zero in-engine production consumers; HNSW vector index is currently a linear scan. Q11 in §14. |
| **AI Generation** | 🧪 Orphan Source | `astraweave-ai-gen/` holds 4 loose source files with no `Cargo.toml` and no crate root — not a workspace member, cannot build as-is. See the dormant-code taxonomy in [`ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) §5. |

## 🤝 Contributing

<!-- Source: CLAUDE.md (Mandate §1 "Zero Human Code") + strategic framing in
     post-trace-campaign Pages reconciliation. "100% by AI" preserved as the
     literal project mandate; the AI-augmented framing acknowledges the GCP
     methodology that produces and audits the code. -->
AstraWeave is an experimental project being built **solo through AI-augmented development** under the [**Genesis Code Protocol (GCP)**](CLAUDE.md) — a methodology that pairs AI code generation with forensic auditing (the architecture trace campaign) as a counterweight to AI-generated documentation drift. The project's mandate is zero human-written code; the audit campaign is how that mandate stays honest.

**Current Development Status:**
<!-- Source: cargo metadata + live counts 2026-06-10; MASTER_COVERAGE_REPORT v5.3.0;
     EDITOR_MULTI_TOOL_ARCHITECTURE_CAMPAIGN.md; campaign closeout docs under docs/audits/. -->
-   **~51 production crates** across 130 workspace members with 57.35% whole-workspace LLVM line coverage (~39,000+ test annotations)
-   **Editor**: Active mid-campaign with 9,425 test annotations (Multi-Tool Architecture Sub-phase 5 in flight; Sub-phases 3/4 complete)
-   **Architecture**: 13 subsystem traces under [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) + the [Architecture Map](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) (v0.7.2) + the [Interactive Workspace Map](https://lazyxeon.github.io/AstraWeave/architecture/)
-   **Research surface (in-design, not runtime-wired)**: Fluids, Memory pipeline, Coordination, RAG composite, advanced GOAP, LLM production-hardening — see §5.1 of the architecture map
-   **Active Phases**: Editor Multi-Tool Architecture Sub-phase 5 (5.C closeout, Mediator Removal, Sub-phase 6 pending). Phase 8.8 Physics Robustness paused since Feb 2026. Recently closed: Net-Trio-Remediation (Jun 10), Terrain Asset Quality (Jun 2), Unified Camera (Jun 1), Render Parity (May 17)
