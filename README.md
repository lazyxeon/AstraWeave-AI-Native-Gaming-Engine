# Veilweaver: Threads of Eternity
Veilweaver: Threads of Eternity is a research platform and playable vertical slice for
building AIâ€‘native games. It delivers a complete engine and toolkit for creating rich,
emergent RPG experiences where companions learn, bosses adapt, and the world itself can
be altered through Fateâ€‘Weaving. In addition to the core engine, the repo contains modular
gameplay systems, authoring tools, and demos showing how to stitch everything together.
 Highlights

## AIâ€‘Native Engine (AstraWeave) â€“ Deterministic ECSâ€‘style simulation with strict toolâ€‘sandboxing for
AI planners. Companions propose actions; the engine validates lineâ€‘ofâ€‘sight, cooldowns and
navmesh before execution. Includes 3D rendering (via wgpu), custom shaders, depth/lighting,
weather VFX and letterbox/fade overlays.

## Robust Physics & Navmesh â€“ Rapier3D integration for rigid bodies, character controller (grounded/
climb/swim), ragdolls, destructible objects, buoyancy, wind and dynamic weather. Lightweight
navmesh baking and A* pathfinding with funnel/stringâ€‘pull refinement.

## Adaptive AI Systems â€“ Persistent companion AI profiles ( .cprof ) that learn your tactics and
preferences. Boss director with multiâ€‘phase behaviour, budgeted fortify/collapse/spawn operations,
portal graphs and telegraphed phase shifts.

## AI NPC system - all npc's have ai dialogue, actions, reactions.

## Gameplay Modules â€“ Fateâ€‘Weaving (terrain/weather manipulation with consequences), crafting and
echo infusion, comboâ€‘based combat, resource harvesting, procedurally generated biomes,
branching dialogue with variables, quests and cutscenes.

## Audio & Dialogue â€“ Background music with crossfades, spatial sound effects, voiceâ€‘over playback
and fallback textâ€‘toâ€‘speech (adapter), automatic music ducking during dialogue. A voiceâ€‘bank loader
and dialogue runtime map nodes to audio files.

## Authoring & Modding Tools â€“ Rhai scripts for encounter tuning, persona packs for companions,
voice bank definitions, TOMLâ€‘based dialogue and quest files. Example demos show how to assemble
levels, dialogues, AI behaviour and physics into playable scenes.

## Network & IPC â€“ WebSocketâ€‘based intent replication for coâ€‘op/multiplayer, with serverâ€‘authoritative
validation. IPC layer for swapping local AI with edge/cloud models.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and install dependencies with Rust's nightly toolchain. Examples can be run directly
with Cargo:
# run a 3D world with basic companion planning and rendering
cargo run -p weaving_playground
# craft an item, infuse an echo and test a combat combo
cargo run -p crafting_combat_demo
# hear dialogue lines with voiceâ€‘over and subtitles
cargo run -p dialogue_voice_demo
# explore ragdolls, destructible objects, climbing and swimming in physics
playground
cargo run -p physics_demo3d
# observe an adaptive boss using multiâ€‘phase director
cargo run -p phase_director
To see the navmesh bake and pathfinding in action:
cargo run -p navmesh_demo
For a cutscene with camera control and letterbox fade:
cargo run -p cutscene_render_demo
Development Environment
The project uses the following crates and tools:
wgpu for crossâ€‘platform GPU rendering.
Rapier3D for physics simulation and kinematic character control.
rodio for audio playback (music, SFX, voice).
serde/toml for dataâ€‘driven content (recipes, quests, dialogue, voice maps).
rhai for scripting encounter budgets and hints.
Crossbeam/tokio (in the network examples) for async WebSocket servers.
Ensure you have Rust 1.73+ installed with cargo. Some demos require the --features ollama flag if you
want to integrate your own LLM backend.

## ðŸ”’ Security & Quality Assurance

Veilweaver implements several security and quality assurance workflows to ensure code reliability and safety:

### OpenSSF Scorecard
We use the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/) to continuously monitor our security posture and best practices compliance.

### Security Auditing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated checks for vulnerable dependencies using cargo-audit
- **License Compliance**: Verification of dependency licenses using cargo-deny
- **Vulnerability Reporting**: Clear process for reporting security issues (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md))

### Code Quality
- **Static Analysis**: Rust's Clippy for code quality and potential bug detection
- **Formatting Standards**: Enforced code style with rustfmt
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Advanced static analysis for security vulnerabilities

### Continuous Integration
- **Cross-platform Testing**: Automated testing on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Tracking performance metrics over time
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatic API documentation updates

## Acknowledgements
Veilweaver was inspired by the desire to explore AIâ€‘native games where companions and enemies adapt to
the player. Thanks to the openâ€‘source community for wonderful crates like wgpu , Rapier3D and
rodio , without which this project would not exist.
