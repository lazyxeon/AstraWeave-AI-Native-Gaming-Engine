## Quick Stats

| Metric | Result | Target | vs Target |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **sparse_set.rs Coverage** | **+13.96%** (83.99% ‚Üí 97.95%) | +5-8% | **+175% OVER** üéâ |
| **Overall ECS Coverage** | **+1.34%** (94.18% ‚Üí 95.52%) | +0.6-1.0% | **+34% OVER** |
| **Tests Added** | 13 surgical tests | 5-8 tests | **+62% MORE** |
| **Time Spent** | 0.45h (27 min) | 1-1.5h | **73% UNDER** ‚ö° |
| **Pass Rate** | 23/23 (100%) | 100% | **PERFECT** ‚úÖ |

## What We Did

1. **Generated HTML Coverage Report** (0.1h)
   - `cargo llvm-cov --html --output-dir coverage/html`
   - Identified sparse_set.rs as worst file (83.99%, 57 missed lines)

2. **Analyzed sparse_set.rs** (0.1h)
   - Read 398-line file
   - Found 14 cold paths (with_capacity, idempotent insert, large IDs, get_mut, etc.)

3. **Wrote 13 Surgical Tests** (0.2h)
   - SparseSet edge cases: 6 tests
   - SparseSetData<T> edge cases: 7 tests
   - ~250 lines of high-precision tests

4. **Validated** (0.05h)
   - 23/23 tests passing
   - Coverage: 83.99% ‚Üí 97.95% (+13.96%!)
   - Overall: 94.18% ‚Üí 95.52% (+1.34%)

---

## Key Achievement

**ONE FILE (sparse_set.rs) delivered 91% of the total coverage gain** with surgical precision testing.

This is the **highest single-file ROI in Phase 5B history**:
- **3.0% coverage per hour** (vs 1.5% for broad testing)
- **2√ó efficiency** compared to Days 1-2

## Week 6 Cumulative (Days 1-3)

| Metric | Start | After Day 3 | Total Change |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Coverage** | 89.43% | **95.52%** | **+6.09%** |
| **Tests** | 136 | 194 | +56 |
| **Time** | 0h | 3.45h | 3.45h / 4.5h (77%) |
| **Files >95%** | 4/12 | 7/12 | +3 |

**Three files transformed**:
- Day 1: system_param.rs 57.23% ‚Üí 98.70% (+41.47%)
- Day 2: lib.rs 81.91% ‚Üí 97.66% (+15.75%)
- **Day 3: sparse_set.rs 83.99% ‚Üí 97.95% (+13.96%)**

## Lessons Learned

1. **HTML coverage reports are GOLD** üèÜ
   - 20 seconds to generate
   - Shows exact missed lines/regions
   - Enables surgical targeting

2. **One deep dive > Multiple shallow passes**
   - 13 tests on 1 file (+13.96%) beats 11 tests on 3 files (+9%)
   - Faster (no context switching)
   - More satisfying (complete milestone)

3. **User strategic guidance = force multiplier**
   - User's "focused, high-yield mini Day 3" constraint forced efficiency
   - User's "ECS edge cases" guidance provided conceptual framework
   - Result: 2.5√ó expected improvement

4. **Surgical testing = 2√ó ROI**
   - Broad testing: ~1.5% per hour
   - Surgical testing: ~3.0% per hour
   - When to use: High existing coverage (>80%) with specific gaps

## Decision Point

**Current**: 95.52% coverage (1.48% from 97% goal)

**Options**:
- **A**: Continue to blob_vec.rs + archetype.rs (0.7h, +1.0-1.3%, reach ~96.5%)
- **B**: Stop at 95.52% (save 0.7h for Day 4 benchmarks, accept excellence)
- **C**: Quick blob_vec.rs only (0.3h, +0.5-0.7%, reach ~96.0%)

**Recommendation**: **Option B - Stop at 95.52%**

**Rationale**:
- Mission accomplished (2.5√ó expected improvement)
- ROI drops 37-53% for additional work
- Day 4 benchmarks are CRITICAL (performance baseline)
- 0.7h saved ‚Üí Week 7 buffer (astraweave-render complex)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Day 3 COMPLETE (this summary)
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Day 4: Performance benchmarks (0.5h, CRITICAL)
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Day 5: Comprehensive Week 6 documentation (0.5h)
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Week 7: astraweave-render OR physics+gameplay combo
