# AstraWeave: Executive Pitch Deck

> **🎯 The first AI-native game engine: Where artificial intelligence becomes genuinely intelligent gameplay**

---

## 🚀 The Opportunity

### Game AI is Fundamentally Broken

❌ **Predictable** - Scripted behaviors feel robotic and repetitive  
❌ **Cheating** - AI breaks game rules (wallhacks, infinite resources)  
❌ **Static** - No learning or adaptation across gaming sessions  
❌ **Disconnected** - AI can't meaningfully interact with complex game systems  

### The Market is Ready

- **Game Engine Market**: $2.8B growing at 16.7% CAGR
- **AI in Gaming**: $922M growing at 23.3% CAGR  
- **LLM Capabilities**: 7B-12B models now enable real-time gaming decisions
- **Developer Demand**: Growing frustration with traditional AI limitations

---

## 💡 The Solution: AstraWeave

**AI-Native Architecture** - Built from the ground up for intelligent agents

### The Paradigm Shift

```
❌ Traditional: Game Logic → AI System → Scripted Behaviors
✅ AstraWeave:  AI Agents ← Tool Validation ← Engine Authority
```

**Key Innovation**: AI can only act through validated tools - no cheating possible
