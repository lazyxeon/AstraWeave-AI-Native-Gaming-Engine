- ✅ Component-Based Inspector (extensible trait system)

**Phase 3: Productivity Layer** ✅
- ✅ Asset Browser (file tree, thumbnails, drag-drop, filters)
- ✅ Hierarchy Enhancements (drag-drop parenting, multi-select, context menu)
- ✅ Snapping & Grid (grid snap, angle snap, vertex snap)
- ✅ Copy/Paste/Duplicate (Ctrl+C/V/D workflow)

**Phase 4: Advanced Features** ✅
- ✅ Prefab System (create, instantiate, overrides, nested prefabs)
- ✅ Play-in-Editor (Play/Pause/Stop, snapshot restore, frame stepping)
- ✅ Hot Reload (notify-based file watching, asset auto-reload)

**Phase 5: Polish & Ecosystem** ✅ (Completed November 24, 2025)
- ✅ Advanced Viewport (multi-viewport, view modes, camera bookmarks)
