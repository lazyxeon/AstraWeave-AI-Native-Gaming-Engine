# AstraWeave CI/CD Pipeline

This document describes the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline implemented for the AstraWeave AI-Native Gaming Engine.

## Overview

The CI pipeline has been optimized following Rust best practices and includes:

- **Comprehensive testing** across multiple platforms
- **Advanced caching** with sccache for faster builds
- **Security auditing** and dependency management
- **Code quality enforcement** with rustfmt and clippy
- **Performance monitoring** and build optimization
- **Intelligent job orchestration** with proper dependencies

## Workflows

### 1. Comprehensive CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Primary workflow** for code validation and testing.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

**Jobs:**
- **check**: Quick validation across platforms
- **build**: Debug and release builds with testing
- **code-quality**: Formatting, linting, and security audits
- **msrv**: Minimum Supported Rust Version validation
- **demo**: Functional validation of key examples

**Key Features:**
- **Smart platform matrix**: Full testing on Linux, selective testing on macOS/Windows
- **Advanced caching**: sccache integration for ~50-70% build time reduction
- **Fail-fast disabled**: Continue testing other platforms even if one fails
- **Timeout protection**: Prevents hanging jobs with appropriate limits

### 2. Dependency Management (`dependency-management.yml`)

**Automated dependency health and security monitoring.**

**Triggers:**
- Daily schedule (2 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch with configurable options

**Jobs:**
- **security-audit**: cargo-audit and cargo-deny security scanning
- **cache-optimization**: Cross-platform cache warming and management
- **workspace-analysis**: Dependency tree analysis and unused dependency detection

### 3. Other Workflows

- **toolchain-management.yml**: Multi-version Rust toolchain testing
- **benchmark.yml**: Performance regression testing
- **docs.yml**: Documentation building and deployment
- **release.yml**: Automated release management
- **security-audit.yml**: Advanced security scanning
- **scorecard.yml**: OSSF security scorecard

## Exclusion Strategy

### Problematic Crates

The following crates are excluded from workspace operations due to compilation issues:

```bash
astraweave-author       # rhai sync/send trait issues
visual_3d               # egui/winit API mismatches  
ui_controls_demo        # egui API compatibility issues
npc_town_demo           # Multiple API mismatches
rhai_authoring          # depends on broken astraweave-author
cutscene_render_demo    # graphics API issues
weaving_playground      # dependency issues
combat_physics_demo     # API mismatches
navmesh_demo            # API mismatches
physics_demo3d          # API mismatches
debug_toolkit_demo      # rand version conflicts and egui API issues
aw_editor               # eframe API issues and Send/Sync trait problems
```

### Core Working Components

These crates form the stable foundation and are always included:

```bash
astraweave-core         # ECS world, validation, intent system
astraweave-ai           # AI orchestrator and planning
astraweave-physics      # Rapier3D wrapper with character controller
astraweave-nav          # Navmesh baking and A* pathfinding
astraweave-render       # wgpu-based 3D rendering
astraweave-gameplay     # Game mechanics and systems
astraweave-audio        # Audio engine with spatial effects
astraweave-input        # Input handling and device management
astraweave-ui           # UI framework integration
astraweave-net          # Networking and multiplayer
astraweave-director     # AI director systems
astraweave-memory       # Memory management utilities
astraweave-persona      # Character persona system
astraweave-ipc          # Inter-process communication
astraweave-llm          # LLM integration
astraweave-sdk          # SDK for external developers
hello_companion         # Primary demo application
```

## Optimization Features

### Build Performance

- **sccache integration**: Shared compilation cache across builds
- **Smart dependency caching**: Version-aware cache keys
- **Parallel job execution**: Independent jobs run concurrently
- **Strategic build matrix**: Reduced redundant builds while maintaining coverage

### Cache Management

- **Multi-level caching**: Rust cache + sccache + dependency cache
- **Cross-platform optimization**: Platform-specific cache strategies
- **Automatic cache warming**: Daily scheduled cache maintenance
- **Cache cleanup**: Manual and automated cache management

### Error Handling

- **Graceful degradation**: Continue on non-critical failures
- **Comprehensive timeouts**: Prevent resource waste from hanging jobs
- **Detailed error reporting**: Clear failure diagnostics
- **Artifact collection**: Preserve build outputs for debugging

## Usage

### Local Development

Use the convenient cargo aliases for local development:

```bash
# Check workspace (excluding problematic crates)
cargo check-all

# Run tests on working components
cargo test-all

# Build core components
cargo build-core

# Build working examples
cargo build-working

# Run clippy on all working code
cargo clippy-all
```

### Manual CI Triggers

**Dependency Management:**
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions UI:
# - Cache Action: warm | clean | rebuild
# - Security Audit: true | false
```

**Toolchain Management:**
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions UI:
# - Toolchain Version: stable | beta | nightly | 1.89.0
# - Performance Benchmarks: true | false
```

## Monitoring

### Build Performance Tracking

- **Build time trends**: Monitor compilation performance over time
- **Cache hit rates**: Track caching effectiveness
- **Resource utilization**: Memory and CPU usage analysis
- **Dependency analysis**: Track dependency tree changes

### Security Monitoring

- **Daily security audits**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency updates**: Track outdated and vulnerable dependencies
- **License compliance**: Ensure license compatibility
- **Supply chain security**: Monitor dependency integrity

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Fail-Fast Strategy**: Don't stop all jobs on single failure
2. **Smart Caching**: Version-aware cache keys with cross-platform optimization
3. **Resource Optimization**: Appropriate timeouts and concurrency limits
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing tools
5. **Security First**: Regular audits and vulnerability scanning
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous build performance tracking
7. **Documentation**: Clear rationale for all optimizations and exclusions

## Future Improvements

- [ ] **WebAssembly target support**: Add WASM compilation testing
- [ ] **Container-based caching**: Docker layer caching for dependencies
- [ ] **Distributed build caching**: Shared cache across team members
- [ ] **Advanced dependency optimization**: Automated dependency graph analysis
- [ ] **Real-time dashboards**: Build performance and health monitoring
- [ ] **Automated dependency updates**: Safe automated dependency upgrades

## Troubleshooting

See `docs/src/resources/troubleshooting.md` for common issues and solutions.

For CI-specific issues:
1. Check the exclusion list if builds fail
2. Verify system dependencies are installed
3. Check cache hit rates for performance issues
4. Review security audit reports for vulnerabilities
