## Week 5: astraweave-input

### Planning Complete ✅

**Target**: 60 tests, 75-85% coverage, 10 hours  
**Timeline**: Oct 24-26 (3 days)  
**Strategy**: Apply Week 4's coverage breakthrough patterns

### Day-by-Day Breakdown

| Day | Focus | Tests | Hours | Deliverable |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Day 1** | Baseline + Unit Tests | 15-20 | 2.5-3h | WEEK_5_DAY_1_BASELINE.md |
| **Day 2** | Stress + Edge Cases | 30-40 | 3-3.5h | WEEK_5_DAY_2_COMPLETE.md |
| **Day 3** | Integration + Benchmarks | 10-20 | 2.5-3h | WEEK_5_DAY_3_COMPLETE.md |
| **Day 4** | Documentation | 0 | 1-1.5h | WEEK_5_COMPLETE.md |

**Total**: 55-80 tests, 9-11 hours (aim for 7-8h)

### Key Challenges Identified

1. **Platform-Specific Code**: Windows/Linux/macOS input API differences
2. **Gamepad Detection**: May need mock devices for CI
3. **Key Rebinding Persistence**: Config file generation (apply Week 4 pattern)
4. **Input Event Timing**: Frame-dependent processing

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Mock Platform APIs**: Use `#[cfg(test)]` for platform abstractions
2. **Virtual Gamepads**: Create mock gamepad implementations
3. **Config File Generation**: Generate test configs programmatically (Week 4 pattern!)
4. **Deterministic Time**: Use fixed time stepping in tests

---

## Patterns to Apply (From Week 4)

### 1. Coverage Plateau Detection

**Watch for**: +0.00% coverage for 2+ days

**Response**:
1. Run `cargo llvm-cov --show-missing`
2. Identify uncovered clusters
3. Check for missing test data (config files, device profiles)
4. Generate data programmatically
5. Re-measure (expect +10-20%)

### 2. Zero-Dependency Fixtures

**Week 4 Example**: 94-line WAV file generator (no external tools)

**Week 5 Application**:
```rust
// Generate key binding config
fn generate_test_config(path: &Path) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let config = r#"
[bindings]
move_forward = "W"
jump = "Space"
fire = "Mouse1"
"#;
    std::fs::write(path, config)
}

// Mock gamepad device
struct MockGamepad {
    buttons: [bool; 16],
    axes: [f32; 6],
}
```

### 3. Helper Functions

**Pattern**: Extract common test setup/assertions

**Week 5 Examples**:
```rust
fn create_test_input_system() -> InputSystem { /* ... */ }
fn simulate_key_press(system: &mut InputSystem, key: KeyCode) { /* ... */ }
fn assert_binding_exists(system: &InputSystem, action: &str) { /* ... */ }
```

### 4. Pragmatism Over Perfection

**Philosophy**: "Good enough" solutions that pass tests > perfect solutions

**Week 5 Applications**:
- Mock gamepads (not real hardware)
- Simple configs (not full asset pipeline)
- Synthetic events (not OS-level injection)
