- Week-by-week achievements breakdown
- Performance baseline summary

#### B. Current State Deep Dive
- Compilation health (Week 5 fixes validated)
- Performance bottleneck analysis (rendering likely bottleneck)
- Code quality assessment (unwrap usage: 579 remaining)
- Infrastructure maturity (benchmark CI, SDK, cinematics)

#### C. Phase B Strategic Analysis
- Month 4 Plan: Profiling & baseline optimization (Weeks 6-9)
- Month 5 Plan: Parallel ECS & multi-threading (Weeks 10-13)
- Month 6 Plan: Material batching & RAG foundation (Weeks 14-17)
- Success metrics (500 entities @ 60 FPS, <16.67 ms p95)

#### D. Week 6 Detailed Action Plan
- **Action 20**: Unwrap Remediation (40-50 unwraps, 3-4h)
- **Action 22**: LLM Prompt Optimization (20-30% token reduction, 4-6h)
- **Action 23**: Asset Pipeline Automation (texture compression, mesh optimization, 6-8h)
- **Action 24**: Tracy Integration (profiling infrastructure, 4-6h)
- **Action 25**: Stress Test Framework (5 scenarios, baseline metrics, 4-6h)
- **Action 26**: Phase B Roadmap (Months 4-6 plan, 3-4h)

#### E. Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- Week 6 risks (Tracy portability, stress test variance, etc.)
- Phase B risks (parallel ECS complexity, material batching, RAG dependencies)
- Mitigation strategies and fallback plans

#### F. Success Metrics & Validation
- Week 6 criteria (5 mandatory + 1 optional = 6 actions)
- Phase B criteria (500 entities @ 60 FPS, parallel ECS, material batching, RAG)
- Recommendations (immediate, short-term, medium-term, long-term)

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Error Handling Policy Now Explicit
- **Before**: Implicit expectation to fix errors
- **After**: EXPLICIT zero-tolerance policy for compilation errors
  - Warnings can be deferred and documented
  - Errors must be fixed immediately
  - Never leave broken code

### 2. AI-Only Development Emphasized
- **Before**: Mentioned in project overview
- **After**: CRITICAL callout at top of instructions
  - Reinforced in multiple sections
  - Added celebration/motivation language
  - Footer attribution

### 3. Week 6 Direction Clear
- **Phase A cleanup**: Complete deferred Week 5 actions (unwrap, LLM, assets)
- **Phase B foundation**: Tracy profiling, stress testing framework
- **Phase B planning**: Months 4-6 roadmap with weekly breakdowns
- **Target**: 6 actions, 24-32 hours over 5 days

### 4. Phase B Goals Defined
- **Performance**: 500 entities @ 60 FPS (2.5√ó current capacity)
- **Scalability**: Parallel ECS (2-4√ó throughput)
- **Rendering**: Material batching (3-5√ó draw call reduction)
- **AI Enhancement**: RAG foundation (vector DB, semantic search)
- **Timeline**: Months 4-6 (October 14 - January 3, 2026)
